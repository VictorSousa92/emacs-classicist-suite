;;; Commentary:

;; A WORK OPENED AT A BOOK, by the letter a classicist uses: `Theta' for the
;; ninth book of the Metaphysics, and not `1045b27'.
;;
;; The corpora do not know books.  Aristotle's works declare two levels apiece
;; -- `Bekker page' and `line' -- and there is no third for the book, so
;; `classicist-browser-goto-passage' cannot be asked for one.  What the corpora
;; DO carry is the book's title, in the text, in braces:
;;
;;     {ΑΡΙΣΤΟΤΕΛΟΥΣ
;;                     ΤΩΝ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΑ ΦΥΣΙΚΑ Α}
;;     {Α ΕΛΑΤΤΟΝ}
;;     {Β}
;;     {Γ}
;;
;; So the books can be found by reading the work and noting where each title
;; falls.  Which is what this does, once per work, and remembers.
;;
;; THE NUMBERING IS THE TEXT'S OWN.  `2' is the second title the work carries,
;; whatever that is -- and in the Metaphysics it is Alpha Minor, a book between
;; Alpha and Beta which the tradition does not number.  A reader who says `2'
;; and means Beta would be off by one from there on, so the completion shows
;; every book with its letter, its number and its page, and a reader chooses by
;; looking rather than by counting.
