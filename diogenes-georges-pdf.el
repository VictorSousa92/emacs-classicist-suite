;;; Commentary:

;; The scans of Georges' _Handwörterbuch_ (8th ed., 1913-1918), opened at the
;; page holding a word, with `pdf-tools' or `doc-view'.
;;
;; This was once the whole of `diogenes-georges.el'.  Now that the
;; Handwörterbuch is searchable as XML, the printed page is where Bailly's
;; is: reached by pressing `G' a second time from inside a Georges entry, and
;; from nowhere else.  `diogenes-lookup-georges' does that dispatching; this
;; module registers the "[PDF (G)]" link that says so, and binds no key of
;; its own.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; BOOKMARKS THAT LIST A PAGE'S WHOLE CONTENTS
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; These scans are bookmarked once per page, and the bookmark names not the
;; page's first entry but EVERY entry on it:
;;
;;   Bd1_Sp0005-0006_a-3_abacinus_abactio_abactor_abactus-1_abactus-2_...
;;
;; -- volume, the printed column range (Spalten 5-6), then the headwords,
;; underscore-separated, with a numeral suffix on homographs (abactus-1) and
;; a hyphen where a headword is more than one word (Acca-Larentia,
;; Iccius-portus).  A page with more entries than the title can hold ends in
;; "ua13": und andere, thirteen further entries not named.
;;
;; That gives some 43 000 (headword, page) pairs, which is far more than a
;; running head would: a word that IS named is placed on its exact page.  A
;; word that is not -- one of the "ua" remainder, a spelling Georges files
;; differently, or a word he does not have at all -- is placed on the page of
;; the last named entry before it alphabetically, which is the page it would
;; be on if it were there, and in practice the page it IS on when the title
;; was truncated.  The echo area says which of the two happened.
;;
;; The OCR of these titles is good but not perfect -- occupatio appears as
;; "oceupaetio", quirrito as "guirrito" -- and a garbled headword sits in the
;; wrong alphabetical place, which would misdirect a binary search.  So only
;; the longest non-decreasing run of the headwords is kept, by the same
;; `diogenes-cambridge--monotone-backbone' the Cambridge Greek Lexicon module
;; uses on its OCR'd guide words.  It discards 43 headwords of 43 425 and
;; leaves an index that ascends without exception.
;;
;; Note that this module keys a headword its own way, on the bookmark titles
;; as the OCR left them: ASCII letters and word SPACES, a hyphen counting as
;; a space so that "Acca Larentia" precedes "accado" as the print requires.
;; The XML module cannot do that -- the search it uses discards spaces -- and
;; the two indexes are searched separately, so they need not agree.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-georges-directory "/path/to/georges/")
;;
;; a folder holding both volumes' PDFs; they are taken in filename order, so
;; the usual Georges-1913_Bd1.pdf and _Bd2.pdf need no further arrangement.
