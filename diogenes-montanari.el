;;; Commentary:

;; This module lets you jump from a Diogenes *Greek* dictionary entry
;; (the buffer produced by `classicist-lookup-mode' after a Greek lookup
;; or parse) to the page of Montanari's _Brill Dictionary of Ancient
;; Greek_ that contains that entry, displayed inside Emacs with
;; `pdf-tools' (or `doc-view').  It is the Greek counterpart of
;; `diogenes-old.el' / `diogenes-tll.el' and reuses that module's PDF
;; display code.
;;
;; It works with a Montanari PDF whose outline bookmarks give, for each
;; page, the interval of headwords it covers, e.g.
;;
;;   2: ’Α – Άβιαθάρ
;;   3: άβιαστικός – άβολιτίων
;;
;; i.e. "<column-number>: <first-headword> – <last-headword>" (the two
;; words separated by an en-dash).  A headword is matched to the page
;; whose interval contains it.  No pre-built data and no Perl are
;; needed: the index is read straight from the PDF outline.
;;
;; Because the bookmark text is OCR'd, its accents, breathings and iota
;; subscripts are unreliable, so all matching is done on an
;; accent-insensitive, case-insensitive key of the bare Greek letters
;; (see `diogenes-montanari--greek-key').
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-montanari-pdf-file "/path/to/Montanari.pdf")
;;
;; Then, in a Greek lookup buffer, press `m' or click the "[Montanari]"
;; link shown at the top of the entry.

The key keeps only base Greek letters: combining marks (accents,
breathings, iota subscript, diaeresis) are stripped via NFD
decomposition, letters are lower-cased, final sigma is folded to
medial sigma, and every non-Greek character (stray punctuation,
OCR artefacts such as a leading guillemet, Latin letters) is
dropped.  This lets a properly accented lemma match the unreliable
accentuation of the OCR'd bookmark text.

This function does its own regexp matching and Unicode
normalisation, so it wraps the work in `save-match-data' to avoid
