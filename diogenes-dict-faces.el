;;; Commentary:

;; Colour the parts of a dictionary entry: the Latin being illustrated, the
;; author cited, the work, the locus, the etymology, the grammatical
;; information.  The LSJ and Lewis & Short already arrive coloured, because
;; `diogenes--dict-handle-elt' gives <head> and <sense> faces of their own
;; and `diogenes--dict-xml-handlers-extra' carries `i' and `b'.  This file
;; extends the same treatment to the elements the converted dictionaries
;; use -- Bailly, Gaffiot, Georges -- which the Perseus files do not.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHY FACES AND NOT COLOURS
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Every face here inherits from a standard font-lock or shr face rather
;; than naming a colour.  A hard-coded #8b0000 is legible on one theme and
;; invisible on the next, and Diogenes has no way of knowing which you use;
;; inheriting means an author is drawn in whatever your theme already uses
;; for a function name, which is distinct from a string, which is distinct
;; from a comment.  Customise any of them if the mapping does not suit you:
;; M-x customize-group RET diogenes-dict-faces.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE COLOURED
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; `diogenes--dict-xml-handlers-extra' is keyed on the ELEMENT NAME alone,
;; so it cannot distinguish <hi rend="italic"> from <hi rend="bold">: both
;; are `hi' and both would take one face.  The converted dictionaries
;; therefore rewrite <hi> into `i', `b', `sc' and `sup' when the dictionary
;; file is built -- see `diogenes-dict-flatten-hi' -- which is also how the
;; Perseus files mark emphasis, so `i' and `b' keep the appearance they
;; already have in the LSJ.
;;
;; Element names are case-sensitive here: the XML parser hands the
;; formatter `biblScope', not `biblscope', and an alist key that differs in
;; case simply never matches.

every redisplay of a header reported `Invalid face reference: info-title-1',
once per header line.  A missing face named in `:inherit' is passed over
quietly, where one named directly is not, so this both fixes that and makes
the header themable."

(defun diogenes-dict-flatten-hi (line)
  "Rewrite <hi rend=\"...\"> in LINE as `i', `b', `sc' or `sup'.
Called by a dictionary's builder, because the formatter keys its faces on
element names and cannot see attributes: left as <hi>, italic and bold and
small capitals would all be drawn alike.  A rend value not in
`diogenes-dict-hi-elements' -- `normal', `overline' -- loses its element
and keeps its text, which is what the print does with it anyway.

Nesting is preserved by counting: the closing </hi> of an unmapped rend
must be dropped, and of a mapped one renamed, so the tags cannot simply be
replaced one at a time.

Two things here are less obvious than they look.  The end of the tag is
read out of the match BEFORE anything else is matched, because match data
is global: the `string-match\=' that reads the rend attribute out of ATTRS
overwrites the match on LINE, and taking `match-end\=' afterwards yields the
end of `rend=\"italic\"\=' within the attributes -- around 13 -- rather than
the end of the tag.  POS would then jump backwards, the same tag would
match again, and the loop would never end.

And the pieces are collected in a list rather than appended to a string,
because `(setq out (concat out ...))\=' copies everything accumulated so far
on every tag: quadratic in the entry, which for a dictionary like Georges
-- 586,000 <hi> elements, single articles carrying 2,400 of them -- comes
to some 2 GB of copying over a conversion."
