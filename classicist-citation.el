;;; Commentary:

;; A CITATION IS NOT A BROWSER.  How a passage is named, keyed, abbreviated
;; and turned back into levels is one thing; fetching its text from Perl and
;; drawing it in a window is another.  They lived in one file, and eleven of
;; that file\='s twelve consumers wanted only the first.
;;
;; `tei-diorisis.el\=' took ten citation symbols and five browser ones,
;; `diogenes-org.el\=' seven and three, `tei-browser.el\=' six and two --
;; so two packages in another repository depended on a Perl process and a
;; stream filter in order to render `Ael. NA 1.19.5\='.  They depend on this
;; instead.
;;
;; A CITATION is a list of level strings, outermost first: ("1" "19" "5").  A
;; KEY is that flattened for a hash table or a filename.  A REFERENCE is the
;; whole of it -- corpus, author, work, citation -- and what a reader sees.
;;
;; WHAT IS NOT HERE.  `classicist-open-passage\=', which opens a passage in the
;; browser and so belongs to the browser.  Anything wanting it should ask
;; `fboundp\=' first: citations without a browser is a coherent state, and the
;; guard `tei-diorisis.el\=' already has stops being defensive.
;;
;; NOT QUITE PERL-FREE, and the exception is worth knowing.
;; `diogenes--browser-labels\=' falls back to asking Perl for a work\='s levels
;; when the buffer-local is unset.  `tei-browser.el\=' and `tei-diorisis.el\='
;; set that local themselves and never take the fallback.

;;; Code:
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'seq)
(require 'subr-x)
(require 'text-property-search)   ; prop-match-value, and the searches

;; CALLED AT RUN TIME, from files that require this one or are required by it.
;; Declared rather than required: `diogenes-browser.el\=' requires this file,
;; and `diogenes.el\=' requires that, so requiring either from here closes a
;; circle.  `diogenes-abbreviations\=' is a table and could be required
;; honestly; it is declared with the rest for the sake of one rule.

is a
list in exactly that order.

Recorded once when the buffer is made rather than asked for each time it is
wanted: `diogenes--get-work-labels\=' is a call into Perl, which is cheap once
and
not cheap per reference.

This is what makes a citation renderable.  `(1053a 15)\=' is conventionally
written `1053a15\=' and `(4 208)\=' is written `4.208\=', and the difference is
not
the author but the LEVEL: a page and a line run together, numbered levels take a
stop between them.  Without the labels there is no way to tell which is which,
and rendering would have to know a convention per author -- an open set, where
the levels are a handful.")

Aristotle is cited `1053a15\=' and Plato `246a4\=', the page and what follows
written as one; a book and a verse are cited `4.208\=', with a stop.  The
difference is the LEVEL and not the author, which is why this is a list of
labels: Diogenes names the levels of every work -- `(\"book\" \"verse\")\=',
`(\"Stephanus page\" \"section\" \"line\")\=' -- so one rule per label covers
every
author who uses it.

`pg\=' is there because the corpora abbreviate: the scan finds `pg\=' 341 times
beside `page\=' 1785, and `ln\=', `vol\=', `sect\=' and `chap\=' likewise
beside their
full forms.  Only the paginated ones need listing, the rest taking stops anyway.

Matched as SUBSTRINGS of a label, so `page\=' covers `Stephanus page\=',
`Bekker page\=', `Jebb page\=' and the twenty-odd other editors' pages the two
corpora use -- including any this list has never heard of, which a list of whole
labels could not do.

This affects DISPLAY only.  What a link records is
`classicist-citation-to-key\=', which puts a stop between every level whatever
their labels, because that is reversible and a run-on citation is not:
`1053a15\='
cannot be split back into a page and a line without already knowing which is
which.  So a pattern missing from this list costs a reader `1053a.15\=' where
they
would write `1053a15\=', and costs nothing that has to work."
