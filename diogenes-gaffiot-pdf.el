;;; Commentary:

;; Jump to the page of Gaffiot's _Dictionnaire illustré latin-français_ -- the
;; 2016 typeset edition (Gérard Gréco's "Le Gaffiot 2016") -- that holds a
;; given Latin word, shown with `pdf-tools' (or `doc-view').
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHY BOTH THIS AND `diogenes-gaffiot.el'
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The Gaffiot TEI XML that `diogenes-gaffiot.el' searches has been proofread
;; only as far as F.  This PDF is the whole dictionary, so the two together
;; cover it: `g' shows the XML entry when the file has the word -- a real lookup
;; buffer, with entry navigation and `C-c C-c' -- and falls through to this
;; module beyond it, which opens the page.  Nothing here duplicates the XML
;; side; it is the supplement, and the seam is `diogenes-gaffiot-pdf-fallback'.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; THE PAGE INDEX
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This edition is bookmarked with the FIRST HEADWORD OF EVERY PAGE -- 1 379
;; of them, one per page of the dictionary body (pp. 57-1439) -- which is the
;; ideal case: page N holds every word from its own bookmark up to the next
;; page's, so a word is placed by a binary search over them with no
;; interpolation and no guesswork.  No pre-built data is needed: the outline is
;; read from the PDF with `pdf-info-outline' and cached for the session.
;;
;; Two kinds of bookmark are NOT page guides and are kept out of that search:
;;
;;   * the front matter's "Lettre A - Auteurs - ouvrages" sections, which name
;;     letters but list cited authors (the body's own sections are "lettre A");
;;   * the 944 illustration bookmarks, tagged "(illustr.)".  These sit on the
;;     page where the plate is printed, not in alphabetical order relative to
;;     the page's first word, so including them would break the ordering the
;;     search depends on.  They are indexed separately instead, and when the
;;     word looked up has a plate, the message says which page it is on.
;;
;; Bookmark headwords carry macrons and breves, æ and œ, homograph numerals
;; ("abacus 1"), and -- in this edition -- a Cyrillic ў for y-breve, so they
;; are reduced to ASCII by `diogenes-gaffiot--key' before being compared, the
;; same key the XML dictionary is sorted on.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-gaffiot-pdf-file "/path/to/gaffiot-2016.pdf")
;;
;; Then `g' on a Latin entry reaches it for any word past F, and `L' inside
;; the PDF looks up another word without leaving it.

(require 'diogenes-gaffiot)             ; reuse the collation key

;; Called across files that cannot be required from here without a
;; cycle, and -- where the name is one of this package's own caches --
;; defined inside a `let', which the compiler does not count as a
;; definition at all.
