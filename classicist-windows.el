;; THE ONE PLACE THAT DECIDES WHERE A BUFFER GOES, for every family in the
;; suite: a text in the Diogenes browser, an entry in a lexicon, a hit list
;; from Diorisis, a tree from the treebank, a TEI edition.  Nineteen
;; `pop-to-buffer' and `set-window-buffer' calls answered that question
;; separately before this existed, and the ones that answered it by hand were
;; where the faults were.
;;
;; It lived in `diogenes-lisp-utils.el', which was the wrong house for it
;; twice over: the layer is not a lisp utility, and it is not Diogenes'
;; alone.  `tei-diorisis.el' has called `diogenes--display-buffer' from
;; outside Diogenes since it was written, which is what settled the question.
;;
;; A BUFFER HAS A ROLE -- `browser', `lookup', `morphology', `dictionary',
;; `search' -- found from its name first and its major mode second, in that
;; order because a name is settled when the buffer is created where a mode may
;; be set after it is displayed.  `classicist-role-regexps' is a defcustom, so
;; a module may register its own buffers by name; the roles themselves are
;; still a closed set, which is the next thing here that wants opening.
;;
;; THE NAMES CHANGED with the move, and the old ones are aliased in
;; `diogenes-lisp-utils.el' rather than here, so that a file requiring
;; Diogenes and not the suite still finds them.

;;; Code:
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'seq)
(require 'subr-x)

;; `classicist--role-modes' was a defconst, and is a defcustom under its
;; public name.  Aliased because it was reachable, and a table of modes is
;; exactly the thing somebody will have added to by hand.

Both modules would otherwise win -- purpose through an overriding action,
Doom through `display-buffer-alist', and Emacs consults both before the
action a caller passes -- so an answer given here is given first refusal
instead.  If it declines, they have their say after all.

Two things this does NOT decide.  A lookup made from a frame holding only a
startup page takes that window whatever is set here -- there is a window
going spare and using it is never wrong.  And a `C-c C-c\=' chain stays in
one window, that being what the reader asked for by pressing the key in an

  "Which role a kind should be shown beside, rather than beside the reader.
An alist of (KIND . ROLE): a buffer of KIND is displayed by splitting a window
already showing a buffer of ROLE, wherever the reader happens to be.

`morphology\=' is beside `lookup\=' because the two are the same sort of
consultation and belong in one column.  NOT because an analysis is of the entry
showing there: one may analyse a form while another word\='s entry is open, and
the pairing says where they go rather than what they are about.

And it is the LOOKUP window rather than the selected one: `ml\=' may be pressed
while reading a passage in the browser, and splitting the browser would put the
analysis in the middle of the text.  With no lookup window on the screen there
is nothing to be beside, and the ordinary rules apply.

Read in BOTH directions.  One pair answers for two arrangements: an analysis
divides the entry\='s window, and -- where an analysis is on the screen and no
entry is -- an entry divides the analysis\='s.  Whichever of the two arrives
second joins the first, which is what belonging together means.

The value may also be `selected\=', which is not a role: it means the window the
command was given from, whatever is in it.

    (setq classicist-companion-roles \='((morphology . selected)))

That is the arrangement for a reader who wants an analysis under whatever they
are looking at rather than beside the entry -- and it is deliberately not the
default, since `ml\=' from a passage would then divide the passage.  Being
`selected\=' rather than a role, it is not read in reverse: an entry is not put
beside `selected\=' by it.

Other roles work as well: `(morphology . browser)\=' puts an analysis beside the
text, and `(morphology . dictionary)\=' beside a scanned page.  Set it to nil and
an analysis takes a window by the ordinary rules."

  "Where Diogenes buffers go, said in one word.
A shorthand for the three actions below, and consulted only where the action
for a kind of buffer is nil -- so setting
`classicist-lookup-display-action\=' keeps its own answer for lookups while the
browser and the dictionaries follow this.

  `defer\='   -- the default, and what the package did before this existed:
             whatever is installed decides.  `window-purpose\=' where it is
             loaded, a popup manager under Doom, plain `display-buffer\='
             elsewhere.  A reader who has arranged their windows to their
             liking wants this.

  `reuse\='   -- one window for entries, each replacing the last.  Nothing is
             split and nothing is covered but the previous entry.

  `split\='   -- an entry gets a window of its own beside the text, and later
             entries share it.  A window the first time, reuse after that:
             the alternative -- splitting again for every entry -- fills the
             frame with the same word.

  `frames\='  -- each kind of buffer in a frame of its own, entries gathered
             into the lookup frame.  This sets the gathering; whether a new
             buffer gets a frame at all is `pop-up-frames\=', which is yours
             to set, since it governs the whole of Emacs and not just this.

MIXED, by giving an alist rather than a word.  The three kinds are different
things and there is no reason they should agree:

    ;; the text stays where it is, entries share a window beside it,
    ;; and a scan gets a frame of its own
    (setq classicist-window-behaviour
          \='((browser . defer) (lookup . split)
            (dictionary . frames) (morphology . split)))

A kind the alist does not mention falls back to `defer\='.  `frames\=' for any
kind switches the gathering on for all of them, the gathering being about
which frame a buffer joins rather than about one kind.

None of the four can override two things, both being statements about what
was asked rather than about layout: a `C-c C-c\=' chain stays in the window it
was pressed in, and a frame holding only a startup page yields its window."

  "Show BUFFER and return the window it is in.
The one place that decides where a Diogenes buffer goes, so that a reader
who wants to change it has one thing to change and the package has one
thing to get right.  Nineteen `pop-to-buffer\=' and `set-window-buffer\='
calls answered this separately before, and the ones that answered it by
hand were where the faults were: a `set-window-buffer\=' records no window
history, so `q\=' had nowhere to go back to, and a bare `pop-to-buffer\='
consults no rule, so a startup page kept its window while the text opened
beside it.

KIND selects the action -- see `classicist--display-action\=' -- and ACTION
overrides it, for a caller that has computed one.

FALLBACK is an action for when nothing else has an opinion: after what the
reader asked for, and after the gathering.  A module with a display
arrangement of its own passes it there rather than as ACTION, so that
`classicist-window-behaviour\=' and `classicist-gather-frames\=' can still
answer --
an arrangement the package chose is not a decision the reader made, and
should not outrank one.

SAME-WINDOW puts BUFFER where we are.  Not a preference but a statement
about what was asked: pressing a key inside an entry to see another entry
is staying in one place, and no display rule should overrule it.  It goes
through `display-buffer\=' all the same, rather than `set-window-buffer\=',
so that dedication and the rest are handled properly -- but NOT because that
records the window history, which it does not.  Getting back to what was
displaced is `diogenes-old--return-buffer''s business, and the key bound
beside it.

A frame holding only a startup page is the exception to everything: there
is a window going spare, and taking it is right whatever is configured.
See `classicist--sole-home-window-p\='.

The window is SELECTED unless NO-SELECT, because that is what the calls
this replaced did.  `pop-to-buffer\=' displays AND selects; `display-buffer\='
only displays -- and a reader left in the buffer they came from, looking at
an entry in another window, finds that the keys they expect are undefined,
because the buffer they are in is not the entry.  The distinction is easy to
miss and was missed here."

Bound in the Diogenes buffers themselves -- an entry, a passage, an analysis, a
scanned page -- since going from one to another is something one does while in
one of them.  Nil for a key binds nothing.

`C-c\=' and a letter is reserved for the user by the Emacs conventions, and
`C-c C-<letter>\=' belongs to the major mode; these are major-mode maps, so
these are ours to take.  Under evil the read-only buffers are in Emacs state,
so the chords work there without further arrangement.

The SCANNED page is reached by `C-c C-e\=', which is
`diogenes-old-visit-dictionary-key\=' and not set here: that command prefers the
page opened from the entry one is reading, falls back on
`classicist-focus-dictionary\=', and CYCLES through it when pressed inside a
scan.
So one key does the whole of it, and this table leaves that command unbound
rather than offering a second key that differs in a way nobody can remember.

`diogenes-purpose\=' bound `C-c C-b\=' and `C-c C-l\=' to commands of its own
before these existed.  It no longer does: the keys are the same and the commands
are in the core, so they work whether purpose is loaded or not.

These matter most when the kinds are in FRAMES, where there is no window to move
to with `C-x o\=' -- but they work within a frame as well, which is why they are
bound whatever `diogenes-window-behaviour\=' says.
