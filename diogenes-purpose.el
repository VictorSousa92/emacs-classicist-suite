;;; Commentary:

;; window-purpose (purpose.el) is an ordinary package: Spacemacs enables it
;; for everyone, which is how most people meet it, but anyone may load it and
;; the two cases are the same.  Its action runs before
;; Emacs's normal `display-buffer' machinery -- so it, not `pop-up-frames'
;; or `display-buffer-alist', decides where a buffer is shown.  Out of the
;; box every Diogenes buffer (the browser AND every lookup) has the purpose
;; `edit', the same purpose as ordinary text/code windows.  Because purpose
;; shows a buffer in a window that already carries its purpose, a lookup
;; launched from the browser is placed in the browser's own `edit' window:
;; the lookup appears to "take over" the browser and never opens a window
;; of its own.
;;
;; This module fixes that the purpose-native way, by giving the Diogenes
;; buffers purposes of their OWN, keyed on their major mode:
;;
;;   * dictionary entries        -> purpose `diogenes-lookup'
;;   * analyses and form lists   -> purpose `diogenes-morphology'
;;   * the corpus browser        -> purpose `diogenes-browser'
;;
;; With distinct purposes, purpose keeps each family in its own window: entries
;; share one, analyses another, and the browser keeps its own, so none of the
;; three lands on top of another.  This needs no change to Diogenes.
;;
;; Dictionary PDFs are intentionally NOT purposed here.  purpose.el (at
;; least this Spacemacs version) offers no per-buffer purpose setter and
;; matches only by major mode or buffer name; a dictionary PDF is an
;; ordinary `pdf-view-mode' buffer whose name is just the file's base name,
;; with nothing to distinguish a Diogenes dictionary from any other PDF
;; without listing exact file names.  If you want the dictionary PDFs
;; purposed too, add their buffer-name entries yourself via
;; `diogenes-purpose-extra-name-purposes' (single-file dictionaries have a
;; predictable base name, e.g. "Montanari.pdf").
;;
;; Nothing to load: `diogenes.el' requires this, and it installs itself when
;; window-purpose appears, in either order.  `diogenes-purpose-manage-purposes'
;; turns that off.  The older way still works, if a configuration does it:
;;
;;   (with-eval-after-load 'window-purpose
;;     (require 'diogenes-purpose))
;;
;; It is idempotent; re-applying is safe.

  "The wrapper is gone; see below.")

;; WHAT WAS HERE, AND WHY IT WENT.
;;
;; This module used to install itself as `display-buffer-overriding-action',
;; wrapping `purpose--action-function' so that a Diogenes buffer could reuse
;; the sole startup window before purpose had its say.  purpose ADVISES
;; `display-buffer', so the wrapper ran from inside that advice -- and then
;; called `purpose--action-function' itself, a second time, from within
;; purpose's own machinery.  Once was a split; twice was a reuse.  Which is
;; why a lookup made from the browser took the browser's window on Spacemacs
;; and nowhere else, and why nothing else touched it: not the display action,
;; not `display-buffer-alist', not the thresholds, not the purposes.  None of
;; them was reached.
;;
;; The carve-out it existed for is `classicist--sole-home-window-p' now, applied
;; by `classicist-display-buffer' to every Diogenes buffer whether purpose is
;; loaded or not.  So the wrapper had nothing left to do but the harm.
;;
;; What remains of this module is telling purpose what our buffers ARE.  That
;; is all it should ever have done: purpose decides where a buffer goes, and
;; does it well, given the truth about the buffer.

;;;; Focus: moving between the browser, the lookup and the dictionary
;;
;; With the browser, the lookup and the dictionary each in its own window --
;; and, as Diogenes is meant to be used, the dictionary in a frame of its
;; own -- which of them has the input focus becomes a real question.
;; purpose.el decides WHERE a buffer appears; it has nothing to say about
;; focus, and across frames focus is the window manager's business rather
;; than Emacs's.  What follows is a small set of conventions, each of which
;; raises and focuses the target frame when the target is not on this one:
;;
;;   * opening a dictionary, or turning it to a new entry, focuses it;
;;   * `C-c C-e' goes to the dictionary Entry;
;;   * `C-c C-l' goes to the Lookup;
;;   * `C-c C-b' goes to the Browser.
;;
;; One key per destination, the same in all three buffers, rather than a
;; different letter according to where you happen to be: `C-c C-l' means the
;; lookup whether pressed in the browser or in a dictionary, and a key
;; pressed in the buffer it names does nothing but stay put.  Three keys and
;; three places are easier to hold than six pairings.
;;
;; Prefixed rather than bare letters because `classicist-browser-mode' derives
;; from `text-mode' and the browser is writable -- a bare `D' there would
;; insert a D -- and because the prefixed form matches the keys the browser
;; already has: `C-c C-c' to look a word up, `C-c C-q' to quit, `C-c C-n'
;; and `C-c C-p' to page.  Note that `C-c C-c' MAKES a lookup, where
;; `C-c C-l' returns to one that exists.
;;
;; `C-c C-e' for the entry, and not the `C-c C-d' the mnemonic would
;; suggest: KDE Plasma takes `Ctrl-D' for its own window management, so that
;; sequence never reaches Emacs at all on that desktop.
;;
;; A dictionary buffer is an ordinary `pdf-view-mode' (or `doc-view-mode',
;; or `reader-mode') buffer, which as the Commentary above notes is not
;; distinguishable by mode or name.  So this tracks them itself: every
;; buffer Diogenes displays through `diogenes-old--display-page-buffer'
;; gets `diogenes-purpose-dict-mode', a minor mode whose only job is to
;; mark the buffer as a Diogenes dictionary and to carry the `Q' binding.
;; That marker is also what makes `D' able to find the dictionary again.
