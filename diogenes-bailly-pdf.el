;;; Commentary:

;; Jump from a Bailly entry -- the XML one, shown by `diogenes-bailly.el' --
;; to the same word's page in Anatole Bailly's
;; _Dictionnaire grec-français_ -- in the freely available re-typeset
;; edition "Le Bailly 2020 - Hugo Chávez" (Gérard Gréco et al.) -- shown
;; inside Emacs with `pdf-tools' (or `doc-view').  It is a Greek
;; counterpart of `diogenes-montanari.el' / `diogenes-cambridge.el' and
;; reuses `diogenes-old.el''s PDF display driver.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; THE RUNNING HEADS, NOT THE BOOKMARKS
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The Bailly 2020 PDF *is* bookmarked -- some 2 170 lemmas, roughly one
;; per page -- but a bookmark names a word that occurs SOMEWHERE on its
;; page, not the page's first or last entry, so the bookmarks alone give
;; no page boundaries (the CGL and Montanari modules can key on their
;; bookmarks precisely because those do give bounds).
;;
;; What this edition has instead is a machine-clean text layer -- it is
;; typeset, not scanned -- and a running head on every entry page in the
;; familiar three-part form
;;
;;     ἀγελαδόν                     90                     ἀγέροχος
;;     first lemma on the page   page no.   last lemma on the page
;;
;; Each entry page thus announces its own interval, and the intervals of
;; consecutive pages tile the whole word list with no gaps and no
;; overlaps.  That is a sorted array, and finding a word in it is a
;; binary search.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; TWO WAYS TO GET THE HEADS: LAZY PROBING, OR A PREBUILT .eld INDEX
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Out of the box nothing is built.  A lookup reads ONE head per probe --
;; only the top strip of the page, via `pdf-info-gettext' or `pdftotext'
;; -- and caches it: a cold lookup costs 11-13 page probes, and since
;; every probe warms the cache, later lookups in the same session
;; usually cost one or two, often none.
;;
;; \\[diogenes-bailly-build-index] reads every head in one pass (a few
;; seconds with poppler's `pdftotext') and writes a portable prebuilt
;; index -- `<pdf-name>-index.eld' beside the PDF, in the same spirit as
;; Passow's `passow-index.eld' -- after which even the first lookup of a
;; session, on any machine the file is copied to, needs no probing at
;; all.  Building it is an optimisation, never a requirement: both paths
;; fill the same table and give the same pages.
;;
;; Because the page is *found* by probing, nothing depends on the printed
;; page number matching the PDF page number (in this edition they do
;; match, on all 2 470 numbered heads); the number in a head serves only
;; as the anchor that separates its two lemmas.
;;
;; A head counts as read only when both sides of its page number hold
;; Greek lemmas in alphabetical order.  That is what keeps the front
;; matter -- prefaces, the list of authors, where a page number sits amid
;; prose -- out of the index, and what discards a page whose text came
;; back with body matter attached instead of just the head.
;;
;; The 24 pages that open a letter print a large "Α, α" instead of a
;; running head.  They need no special data: a page with no parsable head
;; is simply not a probe point, and a word sorting before the following
;; page's first lemma is placed on it.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; COLLATION
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; `diogenes-bailly-pdf--key' reproduces Bailly's own macro-alphabetical
;; order: accents, breathings, diaereses, iota subscript, quantity marks,
;; case, the compound interpunct "·", the "*" conjecture mark, homograph
;; numerals ("1 ἄν", "2 ἄν") and the contracted half of a verb lemma
;; ("τελέω-ῶ") are all ignored.  This module does NOT borrow
;; `diogenes-montanari--greek-key', because Bailly prints medial beta as
;; "ϐ" (U+03D0), which that key -- keeping only U+03B1..U+03C9 -- would
;; silently DROP, turning ἀ·ϐαρής into αρης.  Here ϐ folds to β (and ς to
;; σ, ϑ to θ, ϕ to φ, ϰ to κ, ϱ to ρ, ϖ to π).
;;
;; Two finer points, both required by the printed order:
;;
;;   * an apostrophe of crasis or elision closes the gap around it, so
;;     "τῷ ’χλῳ" keys as τωχλω and follows τῶν, where Bailly puts it;
;;   * a real word space does not close up, and sorts before any letter,
;;     so "Διὸς ἱερόν" precedes "διόσ·δοτος".
;;
;; A second, accent-KEEPING key (`diogenes-bailly-pdf--tight-key') breaks
;; ties: where consecutive pages share one accent-insensitive key (the
;; ποιός/ποῖος and τίς/τις/τὶς clusters), the page whose own first lemma
;; is spelt like the word wins.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; ACCURACY
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Checked against the PDF's own 2 170 lemma bookmarks -- an independent
;; witness, since a bookmark sits mid-page while the search knows only
;; page edges: 2 169 land on exactly the bookmarked page.  The one miss is
;; a numbered homograph ("2 ἄρῃ") whose twin "1 ἄρῃ" ends the preceding
;; page: identical spelling, so no collation key could separate them, and
;; the reader arrives one page early with both in view.  Unlike the
;; scanned dictionaries, there is no OCR noise here to allow for.
;;
;; Poppler's `pdftotext' is preferred for reading a page, because its
;; `-layout' output puts the running head on the first line; pdf-tools'
;; `pdf-info-gettext' is the fallback, and on some versions returns more
;; of the page than the strip asked for, in which case heads are refused
;; rather than guessed at.  Set `diogenes-bailly-text-method' to override.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-bailly-pdf-file "/path/to/bailly-2020-hugo-chavez.pdf")
;;
;; Then, from inside a Bailly entry, press `B' or click the "[PDF (B)]"
;; link; optionally run \\[diogenes-bailly-build-index] once.
;;
;; This is the Greek counterpart of `diogenes-gaffiot-pdf.el', and it is
;; reached the same way: not from the LSJ or Pape -- `B' there shows the
;; XML entry, which is complete and wants no supplement -- but from within
;; a Bailly entry, when you want to see the printed page it came from.
;; Gaffiot needs its PDF to cover the letters its TEI lacks; here nothing
;; is missing, so the PDF is never a fallback, only the typeset original.
