;;; Commentary:

;; Jump from a Diogenes *Greek* dictionary entry to the page of Passow's
;; _Handwörterbuch der griechischen Sprache_ (Rost/Palm) that contains
;; that entry, shown in the volume's PDF with `pdf-tools'.  Passow comes
;; in four volumes (Passow 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2); each lives in its own
;; sub-directory holding
;;   * that volume's PDF, and
;;   * an OCR text file whose pages are delimited by lines of the form
;;         ----- N / TOTAL -----
;;     (N = running OCR page number).
;;
;; Passow has no usable PDF bookmarks, so the page is found by PARSING
;; THE OCR to locate the entry, then opening the PDF at the matching
;; page.  The scanned PDFs have one extra front cover page that the OCR
;; numbering lacks, so PDF page = OCR page + `diogenes-passow-page-offset'
;; (default 1).
;;
;; Unlike the PDF dictionaries, Passow has no bookmarks: the page index
;; is built by PARSING THE OCR.  On each body page the printed running
;; head gives the page's first and last entry; we reconstruct that from
;; the text instead.  Two problems are handled:
;;
;;   1. Telling an ENTRY headword apart from Greek merely quoted inside
;;      an entry.  An entry begins at the LEFT MARGIN with a Greek word
;;      followed by a comma or "(" .  Quoted Greek is mid-line or, when
;;      the two-column scan wraps a word to the next line, breaks the
;;      alphabetical order.  We therefore keep only the longest
;;      non-decreasing run of candidate headwords down the page (their
;;      keys ascend; OCR fragments are the order-violating outliers).
;;
;;   2. Locating the word.  FIRST we find the page (or pages) whose
;;      first/last entry bracket the word; THEN, when several pages
;;      qualify (an OCR-mangled bound can widen a page's apparent
;;      range), we pick the page on which the word actually sits between
;;      two real entries, preferring the narrowest range.
;;
;; Volumes are routed automatically by the letter range each volume's
;; OCR turns out to cover, so no per-volume table is needed.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-passow-directory "/path/to/passow/")   ; parent folder
;;
;; where that folder contains one sub-directory per volume.  Then, in a
;; Greek lookup buffer, press `p' or click the "[Passow]" link.
