;;; Commentary:

;; WHERE AN ENTRY IS READ.  The buffer, the keys that move about in it, the
;; links a reader can follow, and the nxml buffer an entry is edited in when a
;; dictionary's XML is wrong.
;;
;; AND THE REGISTRY, which is the suite's extension point:
;; `classicist-lookup-register-dictionary' is called by fifteen dictionary
;; modules to announce themselves, and the banner at the head of an entry is
;; built from what they said.  One clause instead of the fifteen that had to
;; be added to by hand whenever a dictionary was.
;;
;; IT SITS ON `classicist-lexicon\=' and calls into the morphology three times,
;; each at a keypress: the dispatcher asks for a parse or for every attested
;; form when a reader follows a link, and `--lookup-lemma-of' is named
;; `lookup-\=' and does nothing but parse.  Declared, not required -- the
;; morphology requires this file.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'seq)
(require 'classicist-groups)
(require 'classicist-lexicon)

;; DEFINED IN THIS FILE, and the compiler cannot see it.

Registering an ID already present replaces it, so a module may be reloaded.

ID is the symbol the link carries as its `action' property and the symbol
`classicist-perseus-action' dispatches on; keep it unique.  NAME is the label
shown in brackets, KEY the key bound to the same command -- shown after the
name, so the binding can be read off the entry -- and HELP a format string
taking the headword, for the echo area.  LANG is \"greek\" or \"latin\": the
language of entry the dictionary is offered on.  COMMAND is called with the
headword as its only argument.

SHOW says when the dictionary appears, and is the whole of the arrangement
the banner used to spell out by hand:

  `always'         -- a print dictionary: offered on every entry of its
                     language, so long as AVAILABLE-P says this user has
                     it.
  `unless-current' -- an electronic dictionary: offered except in its own
                     lookup buffer, where the link would lead nowhere.
                     Needs BUFFER-P, a predicate that is non-nil when the
                     current buffer is showing this dictionary.  The way
                     back to a language's own dictionary -- the LSJ, Lewis
                     & Short -- is this with `classicist--lookup-own-dictionary-p'.
  `when-current'   -- offered ONLY inside another dictionary's buffer,
                     named by OF.  This is how a printed companion to an
                     electronic dictionary is reached: Gaffiot's PDF from a
                     Gaffiot entry, Bailly's from a Bailly entry.

AVAILABLE-P, if given, is called with no arguments and must return non-nil
for the dictionary to be offered at all.  This is how a dictionary is
optional: every one of them but the LSJ and Lewis & Short passes a
predicate over its own path options, so a dictionary the user has not got
is silently absent from the banner instead of being offered and then
refusing.  The predicate is asked afresh each time an entry is drawn, so
setting a path -- or building an XML -- takes effect at once, with no
reload; it must therefore be cheap, and it must neither signal nor prompt.
`classicist--path-usable-p' is the usual way to write one.

A dictionary with both an XML and a printed edition, such as Gaffiot,
Bailly and Georges, is available when EITHER is: its command dispatches on
which, so the one link leads to whichever the user actually has.  Its PDF
companion, registered separately with `when-current', carries the
PDF-only predicate, so the \"[PDF]\" link appears inside the entry only
when there is a PDF behind it.

DECLARED says the user asked for this dictionary by loading its module,
rather than receiving it with the bundle `diogenes.el' loads; a module
computes it at load time with `classicist--declared-at-load-p'.  A declared
dictionary is offered whatever its paths say, AVAILABLE-P not being
consulted, so that a dictionary you use but have misconfigured explains
itself instead of disappearing.  `classicist-declared-dictionaries' declares
one the other way, by id; either is enough and both together are harmless.

PATHS is the list of option symbols this dictionary reads -- purely so
\\[classicist-list-dictionaries] can report on them.

ORDER sorts the banner, low to high; the shipped dictionaries leave gaps to
sort between.  BIND, if non-nil, binds KEY to COMMAND in
`classicist-lookup-mode-map'.  A key that must serve both languages cannot be
bound this way -- it needs a command that dispatches on
`classicist--lookup-lang', as `diogenes-lookup-pape-or-gaffiot-pdf' does --
so such modules leave BIND nil and bind the key themselves."

Which dictionaries those are is not decided here: each is registered by its
own module through `classicist-lookup-register-dictionary', and
`classicist--lookup-dict-specs' picks the ones this entry should offer.  For
Latin that is normally [OLD], [TLL] and [Georges], then either [Gaffiot]
-- an entry in a lookup buffer, not a PDF -- or, when the entry shown IS
Gaffiot, [Lewis & Short] leading back and [PDF] for the same page in
print; for Greek [Montanari], [CGL], [BDAG], [Passow] and [TGL], then
whichever of [Pape], [Bailly] and [LSJ] is not on screen, and [PDF] inside
Bailly.

Clicking a link (or pressing RET on it) opens that dictionary at the page
holding HEADWORD.  The links are inserted AT POINT, so the caller positions
to the top of the entry they belong to; the initial lookup and each
`classicist-lookup-next' / `-previous' step do this once per entry, so every

The rules `C-c C-c\=' goes by, factored out so that a second command need not

The text-property language is only useful when it is actually a lookup
language.  In a Latin (Lewis & Short) entry the definition prose is tagged
\"english\", so a Latin word under point carries lang=\"english\" -- not nil
-- which is why keying on the property alone failed.  Only \"greek\" and
\"latin\" count; otherwise the language of the entry being read is used.

But not blindly.  Where the element says the text is neither Greek nor
Latin -- the German definitions of Pape, the English glosses of the LSJ --
falling back to a Greek entry\='s language would parse a word of prose as
Greek and answer with whatever sorts nearest.  A Greek lemma is written in
Greek letters, so Latin script under the cursor is prose and there is
nothing to look up.  Greek inside that prose is still recognised, tagged or
not.

In the browser there are no text properties to consult and no lookup
buffer: the language is the one the text is being read in.

Before any of that, the script is consulted.  A word written in Greek
letters is Greek whatever the markup says or fails to say -- and it often
fails to say: Gaffiot quotes his Greek untagged, so a Greek word in a
Gaffiot article would otherwise inherit the article\='s Latin and be parsed
as a Latin word that does not exist.  The same holds of the Greek in Lewis

of their own.  Script is the one piece of evidence that cannot be wrong
