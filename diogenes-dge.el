;;; Commentary:

;; Show the entry of the _Diccionario Griego-Español_ (Madrid: CSIC,
;; 1980- ), the Greek-Spanish dictionary of the Instituto de Lenguas y
;; Culturas del Mediterráneo y Oriente Próximo, for the Greek word you are
;; reading -- in a Diogenes lookup buffer, not a PDF.  From a Greek entry
;; (LSJ), press `d' or click the "[DGE]" link.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This is a sibling of `diogenes-pape.el' and `diogenes-bailly.el', and it
;; works the same way: the DGE comes as TEI XML, entry by entry, exactly the
;; kind of thing `classicist-lookup-mode' already displays for the LSJ and
;; Lewis & Short, so this module adds no display machinery of its own.  It
;; hands the DGE to `classicist--search-dict' as one more dictionary file, and
;; everything the lookup buffer can do comes with it --
;;
;;   * `C-c C-n' / `C-c C-p' walk to the next and previous entry;
;;   * `C-c C-c' on a word looks it up: Greek goes to the LSJ, so you can
;;     step from the DGE back into the electronic Greek dictionary, and the
;;     Latin the DGE quotes goes to Lewis & Short.  The Spanish of the
;;     definitions is tagged as Spanish and is left alone, as Pape's German
;;     is;
;;   * the print dictionaries are one keystroke away, since the entry
;;     carries the usual "[Montanari] [CGL] [BDAG] [Passow] [TGL]" banner;
;;   * every entry opens in a fresh buffer, so the LSJ entry you came from
;;     stays live and reachable.
;;
;; It is NOT one of the print-dictionary modules.  `diogenes-passow.el' and
;; its siblings jump a scanned PDF to a page; there is no PDF here, and no
;; provision for one.  Unlike Bailly and Gaffiot, the DGE has no freely
;; available scan to fall back on -- what the CSIC publishes for nothing is
;; exactly this XML -- so a word the XML does not have is the end of the
;; road, and the module's business is to say which kind of "does not have"
;; it is.  There are two, and they are not alike:
;;
;;   * A GAP.  The word falls inside the range the volumes cover and the
;;     DGE simply has no article for it.  Diogenes then does what it does
;;     for the LSJ -- shows the nearest entry and says so -- which for a
;;     dictionary this dense is information rather than a failure.
;;
;;   * BEYOND THE PUBLISHED VOLUMES.  The DGE is unfinished.  Eight volumes
;;     have appeared and they reach ἐπισκήπτω; ζέω, νόμος and ὕβρις are not
;;     missing but unwritten, and there is nothing to show.  Left to the
;;     binary search, asking for one of them would produce the last entry
;;     of vol. VIII with "showing nearest entry" -- indistinguishable from a
;;     near miss on a word that really is absent.  So the range is checked
;;     first and refused with a message that names the boundary; see
;;     `diogenes-dge-check-coverage'.
;;
;; The boundary is READ FROM THE DICTIONARY, never hard-coded: it is the key
;; of the last entry in the converted file.  Add vol. IX and rebuild, and
;; the coverage grows by itself.  (The advertised range of vol. VIII ends at
;; ἐπισκήνωσις, but the file carries one entry past it, ἐπισκήπτω.  Another
;; reason not to hard-code it.)
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; THE DICTIONARY FILE
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Diogenes looks a word up by binary search over a file of ONE ENTRY PER
;; LINE, sorted by a `key' attribute (see `classicist--binary-search').  For
;; Greek that key is beta code, sorted in the order of the Greek alphabet
;; rather than of ASCII -- see `classicist--beta-sort-function' -- and the DGE
;; TEI has Unicode headwords full of accents, quantities and editorial
;; sigla, spread over one document per volume.  So it has to be converted
;; once:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-dge-source-file "/path/to/xdge_xml")   ; or one file
;;   M-x diogenes-dge-build-dictionary
;;
;; which writes `dge.xml' beside the other Diogenes dictionaries.  Offered
;; automatically the first time you press `d' with no dictionary file
;; present.
;;
;; The TEI is at https://github.com/dge-csic/xdge_xml, one file per volume
;; (xdge1.xml ... xdge8.xml), and all of them belong in one converted
;; dictionary, so `diogenes-dge-source-file' may name a single XML file, a
;; DIRECTORY of them, or a list.  Point it at the clone and it will read
;; them in file-name order.  The dictionary is CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 ES: free to
;; convert and to read, not to sell.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHAT THE CONVERSION REWRITES, AND WHY
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The converted file is a display artefact, rebuilt from the TEI whenever
;; you like; the TEI stays the edition.  Seven rewritings, none of them
;; cosmetic:
;;
;;   * `xml:lang="grc"' becomes `lang="greek"', `"spa"' becomes
;;     `lang="spanish"', `"lat"' becomes `lang="latin"'.
;;     `diogenes--dict-handle-elt' reads the attribute `lang' and defaults
;;     to "english"; nothing in Diogenes looks at `xml:lang'.  Left alone,
;;     every Greek word in a DGE entry -- and the headword itself -- would
;;     count as English, and `C-c C-c' on one would go to Lewis & Short
;;     instead of the LSJ.
;;
;;   * <orth type="lemma"> becomes <head>, as in Pape and Bailly.  That is
;;     the element the formatter draws as a headword and hangs the `orth'
;;     text property on, which is what makes the print-dictionary keys act
;;     on the entry the cursor is in.  It gains `lang="greek"', which the
;;     DGE does not put on it.
;;
;;   * <bibl> becomes <cit>.  The shared <bibl> handler builds a clickable
;;     citation out of an `n' attribute holding a Perseus reference, and the
;;     DGE's 405,561 citations have no such attribute: every one of them
;;     would be drawn as a link with nothing behind it, and clicking one
;;     would fail inside `classicist--lookup-parse-bibl-string'.  Their
;;     <author>, <title> and <biblScope> keep their own faces, so a citation
;;     still looks like one.
;;
;;   * A NUMBERED <sense> gives up its <num> child to an `n' attribute:
;;     <sense rend="num"><num>I</num> becomes <sense n="I">.  The formatter
;;     opens a <sense> with a blank line and prints its `n' as a coloured
;;     label, which is how the DGE sets a numbered sense; the number would
;;     otherwise run on into the text as ordinary characters.
;;
;;   * An UNNUMBERED <sense> becomes <seg>.  This is the other half of the
;;     same point, and it matters more.  The DGE uses <sense> for two
;;     different things: 74,944 numbered divisions (A, I, 1, a\)) and 77,769
;;     unnumbered continuations, which the print runs on inside the sense
;;     they belong to after a semicolon -- they even carry the semicolon,
;;     as <pc>.  The shared handler gives every <sense> a blank line, so
;;     left alone they would break each article into twice as many
;;     paragraphs as it has senses, most of them a clause long.  <seg> has
;;     no handler and no face: the text runs on, which is what the print
;;     does with it.
;;
;;   * <etym> is WRAPPED in a labelled <sense>, and kept inside it so that
;;     it keeps its own face.  The DGE sets an etymology off by position
;;     alone, last in the article; in a reflowed paragraph it runs straight
;;     on from the final citation and reads as part of it.  The label is
;;     ours, not the CSIC's -- see `diogenes-dge-etymology-label'.
;;
;;   * <hi> becomes `i' / `sup' by way of `diogenes-dict-flatten-hi', so
;;     that the face table -- which sees element names and not attributes --
;;     can tell emphasis from a superscript.  The DGE writes 29,301 <hi>
;;     with no `rend' at all, which its own stylesheet renders italic, so
;;     those are given `rend="italic"' first; 110 `rend="sub"' lose their
;;     marking and keep their text, Emacs having nowhere to put a subscript.
;;
;; XML comments are dropped -- there are 26, and two of them contain markup
;; and a stray ampersand that would not survive the trip.  The `xml:id' of
;; the entry is kept, since it is the name of the article in the DGE's own
;; system and worth having; the rest of the <entry> attributes go, the
;; formatter having nothing to do with them.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; COLLATION
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The key comes off the lemma: leading sigla and homograph number dropped
;; (†, *, "1 "), the first word only where a lemma names a phrase,
;; diacritics and quantities gone with the combining marks NFD exposes,
;; everything that is not a Greek letter discarded, and what is left
;; transliterated into beta code and filtered down to the letters
;; `classicist--beta-sort-function' can sort.
;;
;; Discarding the non-Greek is the step that does the work here, because the
;; DGE writes letters INTO a Greek word from outside the Greek alphabet:
;; digamma, the epigraphic heta (hαγρατέρα), and the transcriptional u̯, y
;; and w of reconstructed forms (Ἀhεριγu̯ος, ἐντροκwατᾱς).  Dropping them is
;; not a shortcut but the DGE's own practice, and it can be read off its
;; pages: Ϝαγανόω is set among ἀγαν-, Ϝέος among ἑο-, hαγρατέρα between
;; Ἀγραστυών and ἀγραυλέω, ἐντροκwατᾱς between ἔντριψις and ἐντρομή.  Every
;; one of them is filed as though the letter were not there.  Sorting all
;; 64,373 keys this way and comparing with the order the volumes print them
;; in leaves 228 disagreements, all of them phrases and homographs.
;;
;; It also settles what to do about a headword arriving from elsewhere.  The
;; LSJ hands over beta code ("a)ba/c"), which has to be read as Greek and
;; not thrown away -- so a word with no Greek in it is converted first, and
;; a word with Greek in it is not.  Testing for LATIN letters instead, as a
;; Latin dictionary may, would send hαγρατέρα through the beta table and
;; file it under eta.
;;
;; Two smaller things the source needs help with:
;;
;;   * PRIVATE-USE CHARACTERS.  The DGE sets epigraphic letterforms in the
;;     private-use area of New Athena Unicode, and 38 lemmas contain one.
;;     They are in no beta-code table, so they would drop out of the key and
;;     file the word a letter short.  What each one stands for can be had
;;     from the DGE itself: the `xml:id' of an entry is the project's own
;;     normalisation of its lemma, and it spells them out -- διαιτατ<E1B4>ρ
;;     is `xml:id="διαιτατερ"'.  Hence
;;     `diogenes-dge-epichoric-substitutions'.  (The editors were no
;;     happier about them than we are; vol. VII carries the comment
;;     "<!-- &#xE1B0; ? -->" beside one.)
;;
;;   * ONE LEMMA IS MISTYPED.  Vol. IV has an entry whose lemma reads
;;     "gelidoτρομερός": the stem was typed with the Latin keymap and the
;;     ending with the Greek one, g-e-l-i-d-o standing on the keys of
;;     γ-ε-λ-ι-δ-ο.  The DGE files it between Γελίας and γελίκη, which is
;;     where γελιδο- belongs and nowhere near where τρομερός would go, so
;;     the reading is not in doubt.  Uncorrected it is the one entry in the
;;     dictionary that sorts outside α-ἐπ, and it would take the coverage
;;     check with it: the last key in the file would be `tromeros', and
;;     every unwritten word from ζ to τ would look as though the DGE
;;     covered it.  Hence `diogenes-dge-key-corrections'.
;;
;; Both are lists you can edit, and both act on the KEY alone.  The entry
;; you read keeps the letters the CSIC published, private-use characters and
;; all -- install New Athena Unicode if you want to see them -- because a
;; converted dictionary may re-file an article but should not silently
;; re-spell it.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; ONE WORD OF WARNING ABOUT ἐπί
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; DGE articles can be enormous -- ἐπί is 431 KB on its own line -- and
;; `diogenes--dict-parse-xml' runs `xml-parse-region', which is Lisp, over
;; the whole of an entry before anything is displayed.  The prepositions and
;; the commonest verbs therefore take a few seconds to open where an
;; ordinary entry is instantaneous.  Nothing is wrong; it is the same parse
;; the LSJ gets, over fifty times the text.

first word only, since a lemma may name a phrase (Ἀβώνου τεῖχος) and the

a blank line; the <num> itself is removed, so the number is not shown
twice.  A sense that does not becomes <seg>, which has no handler: the
DGE's unnumbered senses are continuations printed inside the sense they
belong to, and a blank line before each of them -- there are 77,769 --
would break every article into fragments.

Either way the sense's own attributes go: its `xml:id' names the sense in
the DGE's system (\"δελφίς_II1\") but nothing here displays it, and at
152,714 senses it is several megabytes of file.  The article keeps its own;
see `diogenes-dge--convert-buffer'.

Nesting is preserved by counting, closing tags being renamed only if their
opening tag was: senses nest three and four deep, and 31 unnumbered ones
contain a numbered one.  A number that is not plain text is left alone
rather than escaped into an attribute; there is none in the eight volumes,
but a future one is cheaper to leave than to repair.

The end of each tag is read out of the match BEFORE anything else is
matched, since the `string-match' that looks for a following <num>
overwrites the match data -- the same trap `diogenes-dict-flatten-hi'
documents at length -- and the pieces are collected in a list rather than
