;;; Commentary:

;; WHAT A DICTIONARY MIGHT HAVE CALLED IT.  A lexicon is keyed under one
;; spelling and a text may use another: `immitto' is `in-mitto' assimilated,
;; `coeo' is `con-eo' contracted, and a Greek form may be accented where the
;; lemma is not.  Nothing here decides anything -- every plausible spelling is
;; offered, likeliest first, and whoever holds the dictionary keeps the one it
;; actually has.
;;
;; THE BOTTOM OF THE STACK, and it reaches nothing.  Twenty-eight forms, of
;; which eleven are called from outside and seventeen are this module talking
;; to itself.  It compiles alone; `diogenes-perseus.el' requires it.
;;
;; The check that says so was wrong the first time.  A closure that strips
;; comments and not strings reported `--latin-assimilations' calling
;; `--assimilated-offset\=', which is a sentence in its docstring.

  "Initial letters folded together when searching the Latin dictionary.
An alist of (FROM . TO) characters, applied to the FIRST letter of both the
search word and the dictionary key before they are compared.

The Lewis & Short that comes with Diogenes is ordered two ways at once,
depending on where the j falls.  An initial J is interleaved with I --

  I, J, Jabolenus, Iacchus, jacea, jaceo, Jacetani, ja^ci^o

which is alphabetical only if j counts as i -- while an internal j sorts
after i, as it does in print:

  abitus, abjecte, ... circumitus, circumjaceo, ... deitas, dejecte

so folding everywhere trades one set of inversions for another (measured on
the shipped file: 126 with no folding, 129 folding throughout, and fewest
folding the initial letter alone).  Hence the fold applies only to the
first letter.

The u/v distinction is NOT folded: this dictionary keeps separate U and V
sections.  Set this to nil to compare keys literally, as Diogenes\\=' own
`$do_lookup\\=' does -- at the cost of `iacio\\=' landing between the letter
articles and `jacio\\=' overshooting its whole block."

asterisk -- must find itself before anything else is tried.

  * without the CAPITAL MARKER, for a word capitalised because it opens a
    sentence.  Latin has had this since Diogenes\=' own \"Fixed parsing of
    capitalized Latin words\"; Greek had not, and `Εὐφήμει\=' answered with
    `εὐφαής\=' -- the nearest name in `*eu)-\=' -- where `εὐφήμει\=' finds
    `εὐφημέω\='.  See `classicist--beta-drop-capital-marker\='.

  * without the accent an ENCLITIC added, where the form carries more than
    one.  See `classicist--beta-drop-extra-accents\='.

  * and without either, since a capitalised word may also carry an enclitic\='s
    accent.

`delete-dups\=' in the caller removes the repetitions this leaves when a form
needs only one of the two."

  "Forms Morpheus does not analyse, and the headword to look up instead.
An alist of (FORM . HEADWORD), consulted only when a form will not parse at
all, and before falling back on a search for the form itself.

Diogenes\=' analyses are a batch run of Morpheus over wordlists harvested
from the corpora it indexes, so a form those wordlists missed is missing
altogether -- not misspelt, which
`classicist-latin-try-spelling-variants\=' would cover, but absent.  The gaps
are not random: `illidant\=', the present subjunctive of `illido\=', whose
fourteen other forms are all there; `aedium\=', where the wordlists have only
the rarer `aedum\='; `transilire\='.  Each parsed as nothing and fell through
to a search for itself, which found the nearest headword instead --
`illico\=', `aedon\=' the nightingale, `transilis\='.

HEADWORD is a headword, not an offset, so an entry here survives a rebuild
of the Perseus data.  Matching ignores case and the spelling conventions,
so one entry answers for `ualdissime\=' as well as `valdissime\='.

Consulted AFTER the parse, never instead of it: a form Morpheus does know
keeps its own analysis, and an entry here for such a form is simply never
reached.  A serious accumulation of these is an argument for running
Morpheus itself over the form -- it generates paradigms rather than
harvesting a corpus -- rather than for a longer alist."

  "Corrections to the morphology the analyses file records for a Latin form.
An alist of (FORM . PLIST).  FORM is the form as `latin-analyses.txt' keys
it -- bare ASCII, which is what a contraction or an accented spelling has
been resolved to by the time this is consulted.  PLIST takes:

  :info STRING     -- the morphology to print instead, for every analysis
                      of FORM.
  :info ALIST      -- ((OLD . NEW) ...), replacing only the analyses whose
                      morphology is OLD.  For a form with several analyses
                      of which one is wrong.
  :lemma STRING    -- the headword to print instead, for every analysis of
                      FORM.  Where Morpheus has the morphology of one word
                      and the lemma of another: `superstite' is the ablative
                      of `superstes', analysed from `super-sto'.  The entry
                      the dictionary keys open follows the corrected lemma,
                      the file's byte offset being dropped with it.
  :add ENTRIES     -- ((LEMMA . INFO) ...), further analyses to show after
                      those the file gives.  LEMMA nil means the lemma the
                      file already names, so a missing reading of the same
                      word is added without repeating its headword; a
                      string is a headword, whose entry is fetched and
                      shown alongside.

For example, where the batch run of Morpheus over the wordlists labels the
deponent's imperative an active infinitive:

    (setq classicist-latin-analysis-corrections
          \\='((\"experire\" :info \"pres imperat pass 2nd sg\")))

or, where both the lemma and the morphology are wrong:

    (setq classicist-latin-analysis-corrections
          \\='((\"superstite\" :lemma \"superstes\" :info \"abl sg\")))

or, to keep the file's reading and add the missing one:

    (setq classicist-latin-analysis-corrections
          \\='((\"experire\" :add ((nil . \"pres imperat pass 2nd sg\")))))

This is for a form the file analyses WRONGLY.  A form it does not analyse
at all is `classicist-latin-extra-lemmata'; a form whose spelling the file
does not use is normalised before it gets here -- see
`classicist--latin-parse-candidates' -- and neither is a correction.

A long list here is an argument for reporting the analyses upstream rather
than for maintaining it: the data is a batch run of Morpheus, so a
systematic error in it is one error, not a hundred."
