;;; Commentary:

;; Show the entry of Anatole Bailly's _Dictionnaire grec-français_ -- in the
;; re-typeset and corrected edition "Bailly 2020 - Hugo Chávez" (Gérard
;; Gréco, André Charbonnet, Mark De Wilde, Bernard Maréchal) -- for the
;; Greek word you are reading, in a Diogenes lookup buffer.  From a Greek
;; entry (the LSJ, or Pape), press `B' or click the "[Bailly (B)]" link.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This is the Greek counterpart of `diogenes-gaffiot.el', and it works the
;; same way: Bailly comes as TEI XML, entry by entry, exactly the kind of
;; thing `classicist-lookup-mode' already displays for the LSJ and Lewis &
;; Short, so this module adds no display machinery of its own.  It hands
;; Bailly to `classicist--search-dict' as one more dictionary file, and
;; everything the lookup buffer can do comes with it --
;;
;;   * `C-c C-n' / `C-c C-p' walk to the next and previous entry;
;;   * `C-c C-c' on a word looks it up: Greek goes to the LSJ, so you can
;;     step from Bailly back into the electronic Greek dictionary;
;;   * the print dictionaries are one keystroke away, since the entry
;;     carries the usual "[Montanari] [CGL] [BDAG] [Passow] [TGL]" banner;
;;   * every entry opens in a fresh buffer, so the LSJ entry you came from
;;     stays live and reachable.
;;
;; It is NOT one of the print-dictionary modules, and this is where it
;; parts company with Gaffiot.  Gaffiot's proofread TEI stops at F, so
;; `diogenes-gaffiot.el' asks whether a word falls inside its range and
;; sends the rest to `diogenes-gaffiot-pdf.el'.  Nothing of the sort
;; applies here: the Bailly 2020 XML is the whole dictionary, all 110,000
;; articles of it, and it is the same text the PDF prints.  So the PDF is
;; never a fallback and `B' never opens it from the LSJ or from Pape.  A
;; word Bailly does not have is simply a word Bailly does not have, and
;; Diogenes does what it does for the LSJ -- shows the nearest entry and
;; says so, which for a complete dictionary is information rather than a
;; failure.
;;
;; The printed page is still worth reaching, for the typography and the
;; page as an object; `diogenes-bailly-pdf.el' opens it, from INSIDE a
;; Bailly entry only, on the same `B' that brought you here (or the
;; "[PDF (B)]" link in the entry's banner).  Pressing `B' twice therefore
;; walks LSJ -> Bailly entry -> Bailly page, which is the one path where
;; the PDF is what you asked for rather than what was left when the XML
;; came up short.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; THE DICTIONARY FILE
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Diogenes looks a word up by binary search over a file of ONE ENTRY PER
;; LINE, sorted by a `key' attribute (see `classicist--binary-search').  For
;; Greek that key is beta code, sorted in the order of the Greek alphabet
;; rather than of ASCII -- see `classicist--beta-sort-function' -- and the
;; TEI has Unicode headwords full of accents and breathings.  So it has to
;; be converted once:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-bailly-source-file "/path/to/bailly-tei.xml")
;;   M-x diogenes-bailly-build-dictionary
;;
;; which writes `bailly.xml' beside the other Diogenes dictionaries.  Each
;; <entry> becomes one line, its <orth> becomes the <head> the formatter
;; recognises as a headword, and its key is that headword transliterated
;; into beta code and reduced to bare letters, so that the keys the LSJ
;; sends us match.  Offered automatically the first time you press `B' with
;; no dictionary file present.
;;
;; `diogenes-bailly-source-file' may name a single XML file, a DIRECTORY of
;; them, or a list, as Pape's does: the conversion is the same whether the
;; TEI arrives whole or split per letter.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHAT THE CONVERSION DOES TO THE TEI
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Four rewritings, all of them for the formatter's benefit and none of
;; them touching the text.  The converted file is a display artefact,
;; rebuilt from the TEI whenever you like; the TEI stays the edition.
;;
;;   * `xml:lang="grc"' becomes `lang="greek"'.  This one is not
;;     cosmetic.  `diogenes--dict-handle-elt' reads the attribute `lang'
;;     and defaults to "english"; nothing in Diogenes looks at `xml:lang'.
;;     Left alone, every Greek word in a Bailly entry -- and the headword
;;     itself -- would count as English, and `C-c C-c' on one would go to
;;     Lewis & Short instead of the LSJ.
;;
;;   * <orth> becomes <head>, keeping its attributes, as in Pape.  That is
;;     the element the formatter draws as a headword and hangs the `orth'
;;     text property on, which is what makes the print-dictionary keys act
;;     on the entry the cursor is in.
;;
;;   * <etym> becomes <sense n="Étym.">, and <re type="variant"> becomes
;;     <sense n="➳">.  The formatter gives <sense> a blank line and prints
;;     its `n' as a label, which is exactly how Bailly sets an etymology
;;     and a list of dialect forms off from the article; as bare elements
;;     they would have run on into the last sense unlabelled.  The label
;;     the TEI drops -- the printed "Étym." -- comes back here.
;;
;;   * <bibl> becomes <cit>.  The shared <bibl> handler builds a clickable
;;     citation from an `n' attribute holding a Perseus reference, and
;;     Bailly's sigla are not that: "PLUT. T. Gracch. 5" is resolved by a
;;     bibliography (biblio.2020) distributed apart from the dictionary, so
;;     an <bibl> here would be a link with nothing behind it, and clicking
;;     it would fail inside `classicist--lookup-parse-bibl-string'.  Its
;;     <author> and <biblScope> keep their own faces, so a citation still
;;     looks like one.  Should the sigla ever be resolved, the place to
;;     undo this is `diogenes-bailly--rewrite-entry'.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; COLLATION
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; `diogenes-bailly--key' has one job the other Greek dictionaries do not:
;; Bailly prints medial beta as "ϐ" (U+03D0), in 6,209 of its headwords.
;; That character is in no beta-code table, so `diogenes--utf8-to-beta'
;; passes it through untranslated and the filter to beta letters then drops
;; it -- ἀϐαρής would be filed under "aarhs", where nothing will ever look
;; for it.  So it folds to β first, together with the other variant shapes
;; (ς, ϑ, ϕ, ϰ, ϱ, ϖ), exactly as `diogenes-bailly-pdf--key' folds them for
;; the printed page.
;;
;; The rest of what a Bailly headword can carry, measured over all 110,646
;; of them: 1,548 superscript homograph numerals (ἤ ¹, ἤ ²) and the space
;; before them; 60 apostrophes of elision; 38 en dashes on prefix and
;; suffix entries (βου–, -δις); 26 parentheses; 7 asterisks of conjecture;
;; 35 no-break spaces.  All of them drop out.  Three headwords are simply
;; mis-spelt in the source, each once, and each would otherwise be
;; unreachable: a Coptic kapa for κ in θαλίηⲕτρον, a Latin o for ο in
;; συστράτηγoς, and a byte-order mark left on the end of λευκερῴδιος.
;; They are folded here rather than corrected in the TEI, which is under a
;; no-derivatives licence and is not ours to emend.
;;
;; Digamma (ϝέ, ϝέθεν, ϝοῖ) is beta code `v', which sorts between ε and ζ
;; in `diogenes--beta-code-alphabet'; since no table transliterates it,
;; this module spells it out itself.
;;
;; The result: no headword keys to nothing, and 7,332 of them share a key
;; with another -- the numbered homographs, ἤ ¹ against ἤ ², which no
;; accent-blind key could separate and which Bailly means as one word
;; anyway.  They stay in printed order, because `sort' on a list is stable,
;; and `C-c C-n' walks from one to the next.

word returns to the LSJ, and the print-dictionary banner opens Montanari,

is not in it produces the nearest entry, with a message saying so, exactly
as the LSJ does.

With only `diogenes-bailly-pdf-file' set and no XML converted, Bailly is
simply a print dictionary like the OLD, and this command opens the page
rather than explaining what is not installed.  Where the XML IS there, this
command never opens the PDF except in the case below.

Pressed a second time, from INSIDE the entry it has just shown, it opens
that word's page in the printed Bailly instead -- see
`diogenes-lookup-open-bailly-pdf' and `diogenes-bailly-pdf-file'.  That is
