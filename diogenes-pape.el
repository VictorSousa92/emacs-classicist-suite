;;; Commentary:

;; Show the entry of Wilhelm Pape's _Handwörterbuch der griechischen
;; Sprache_ (Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1863-1880) for the Greek word you are
;; reading -- in a Diogenes lookup buffer, not a PDF.  From a Greek entry
;; (LSJ), press `P' or click the "[Pape]" link.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This is the Greek counterpart of `diogenes-gaffiot.el', and it works the
;; same way: Pape comes as TEI XML, entry by entry, exactly the kind of
;; thing `classicist-lookup-mode' already displays for the LSJ and Lewis &
;; Short, so this module adds no display machinery of its own.  It hands
;; Pape to `classicist--search-dict' as one more dictionary file, and
;; everything the lookup buffer can do comes with it --
;;
;;   * `C-c C-n' / `C-c C-p' walk to the next and previous entry;
;;   * `C-c C-c' on a word looks it up: Greek goes to the LSJ, so you can
;;     step from Pape back into the electronic Greek dictionary, and the
;;     Latin Pape quotes goes to Lewis & Short;
;;   * the print dictionaries are one keystroke away, since the entry
;;     carries the usual "[Montanari] [CGL] [BDAG] [Bailly] [Passow] [TGL]"
;;     banner;
;;   * every entry opens in a fresh buffer, so the LSJ entry you came from
;;     stays live and reachable.
;;
;; It is NOT one of the print-dictionary modules.  `diogenes-passow.el' and
;; its siblings jump a scanned PDF to a page; there is no PDF here, and no
;; provision for one.  Pape's TEI is complete, so a scan would add nothing
;; but a second thing to configure.  This is the one substantive difference
;; from Gaffiot, whose proofread TEI stops at F and which therefore needs
;; `diogenes-gaffiot-pdf.el' to reach the rest of the alphabet, needs to ask
;; whether a word falls inside its range before showing an entry, and needs
;; to explain itself when it does not.  None of that applies here: a word
;; Pape does not have is simply a word Pape does not have, and Diogenes
;; does what it does for the LSJ -- shows the nearest entry and says so,
;; which for a complete dictionary is information rather than a failure.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; THE DICTIONARY FILE
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Diogenes looks a word up by binary search over a file of ONE ENTRY PER
;; LINE, sorted by a `key' attribute (see `classicist--binary-search').  For
;; Greek that key is beta code, sorted in the order of the Greek alphabet
;; rather than of ASCII -- see `classicist--beta-sort-function' -- and the
;; Pape TEI has Unicode headwords full of accents, breathings and macrons
;; spread over a document per letter.  So it has to be converted once:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-pape-source-file "/path/to/tei-pape")   ; or one file
;;   M-x diogenes-pape-build-dictionary
;;
;; which writes `pape.xml' beside the other Diogenes dictionaries.  Each
;; entry becomes one line, its <orth> becomes the <head> the formatter
;; recognises as a headword, and its key is that headword transliterated
;; into beta code and reduced to bare letters -- diacritics dropped, ᾱ and
;; ᾰ with them, final sigma folded to `s' -- so that the keys the LSJ sends
;; us match.  Offered automatically the first time you press `P' with no
;; dictionary file present.
;;
;; `diogenes-pape-source-file' may name a single XML file, a DIRECTORY of
;; them, or a list: the TEI is usually distributed as one document per
;; letter (grc.pape-deu1.xml ... grc.pape-deu24.xml), and all of them
;; belong in one converted dictionary.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHAT THE TEI IS ASSUMED TO HAVE FIXED ALREADY
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The Dictan database Pape is digitised from spells some Greek letters with
;; the mathematical symbols they resemble -- U+2206 INCREMENT for delta,
;; U+2126 OHM SIGN for omega, about 1,450 times between them, in headwords
;; and article text alike.  Left alone they would defeat this module\'s key:
;; neither is a Greek letter, and only the OHM SIGN has a canonical
;; decomposition, so stripping diacritics quietly repairs one and drops the
;; other, filing \"Ἁ∆εῖν\" under \"aein\".
;;
;; The conversion to TEI normalises them and records having done so in the
;; <projectDesc> of each file, so nothing is needed here.  If you build the
;; dictionary from some other conversion of the same database and a handful
;; of delta entries turn out unreachable, that is where to look.

Two things happen first.  A headword may offer several forms (\"ἃ ἅ\",
\"α, α. Ἄλφα\") and the first is the one to file it under.  Then diacritics
go: accents, breathings, the iota subscript, and -- the reason the ASCII
rules of the Latin dictionaries will not do here -- the macrons and breves
Pape prints on almost every other headword (ἀγκῡροειδής), which live in
precomposed characters like ᾱ that no transliteration table lists.
Decomposing and dropping the combining marks reduces them to plain υ,
which does transliterate.  Final sigma folds to `s' with the rest.
