;; WHAT THE FORK DID BY EDITING, DONE BY ADVICE INSTEAD.
;;
;; `classicist-windows.el' decides where a buffer goes.  A base that calls it
;; needs no help; upstream Diogenes calls `pop-to-buffer' directly, at sixteen
;; places in eleven functions, and every one of them wants routing through the
;; suite instead.
;;
;; Editing those eleven functions is what the fork does, and it is why the
;; fork exists at all for four of its files.  Advice does the same thing
;; without a fork, because `pop-to-buffer' is an ordinary function and so can
;; be rebound for the dynamic extent of a call -- even inside code that was
;; byte-compiled against the real one.
;;
;; THE COST, SAID PLAINLY.  The rebinding holds for everything called during
;; that extent and not only for the call intended.  None of these eleven
;; displays a second buffer for another reason, so today it is exact; a future
;; upstream that displayed two would give both the same role.  That is a
;; smaller price than a fork of four files, and a louder one: this file names
;; what it advises, where a fork buries it in a diff.
;;
;; NOT LOADED WHERE IT IS NOT NEEDED.  A base that already routes through the
;; suite -- the fork, or an upstream that has taken the patch -- is left
;; alone, function by function, so a base halfway between the two is handled
;; without a switch anywhere.

Sixteen `pop-to-buffer' calls live in these, two of them in

`classicist-role-regexps' -- and `debug' and `edit' are not among the roles
the suite places by name, so they fall to `classicist-window-behaviour' and
are placed as anything unrecognised is.  Which is right: a buffer of Perl
being debugged is not a text and not a dictionary entry.")
