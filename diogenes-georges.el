;;; Commentary:

;; Karl Ernst Georges' _Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch_
;; (8th ed., 1913-1918) as a searchable dictionary, from the TEI XML of the
;; Dictan/Fora digitisation.  From a Latin entry press `G' -- capital, since
;; `g' is Gaffiot -- or click the "[Georges]" link.
;;
;; Built the way Bailly is, and for the same reason: the TEI is one 40 MB
;; document holding 54 740 <entryFree>s in the order the digitiser happened
;; to emit them, which no binary search can use.  So it is converted once,
;; each entry to a line, keyed and sorted:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-georges-source-file "/path/to/georges-tei.xml")
;;   M-x diogenes-georges-build-dictionary
;;
;; and thereafter searched like the LSJ or Lewis & Short, by
;; `classicist--search-dict' over the file the conversion wrote.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; COLLATION
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Georges prints the quantity of every vowel he can -- 15 247 headwords
;; carry a macron on an a alone -- numbers his homographs with superscripts
;; ("ā,²"), and has 220 headwords of more than one word ("Acca Lārentia").
;; None of that can appear in a key: `classicist--ascii-sort-function', the
;; comparator the search uses, throws away everything but ASCII letters
;; before it compares, so a key that kept a space or a numeral would sit in
;; the file at a place the search would never look.
;;
;; One fold earns its place.  Georges has not one j-initial headword in 54
;; 740: he writes consonantal i as i, where Lewis & Short keys `jacio'.  So
;; j is written i in a key, and a lemma arriving from a Lewis & Short entry
;; finds its Georges article.  U and v are left alone -- Georges keeps them
;; apart, as Lewis & Short does.

;; THE PRINTED VOLUMES
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The scans that were this module's whole subject now live in
;; `diogenes-georges-pdf.el', reached by pressing `G' a second time from
;; inside a Georges entry, exactly as Bailly's PDF is reached from a Bailly
;; entry.  Their page index is unchanged.

Three things are removed.  The vowel quantities Georges prints on every

headwords carry an a-macron alone -- are dropped by decomposing to NFD and
discarding the combining marks.  The superscript numeral that
distinguishes homographs goes with them (\"ā,²\" keys as a).  And the word
space of a multi-word headword goes too: there are 220 of them, \"Acca
Lārentia\" among the rest, and `classicist--ascii-sort-function' -- the
comparator the search uses -- discards everything but letters before
comparing, so a key that kept its space would sort in this file at a
place the search would never look for it.

The fold of j onto i is what lets a lemma arrive from Lewis & Short at
all.  Georges has not one j-initial headword in 54 740; he writes
consonantal i as i, where Lewis & Short keys `jacio'.  Both then key as
iacio.  U and v are NOT folded: Georges keeps them apart, as Lewis & Short

  "Show Georges' entry for WORD in a Diogenes lookup buffer.
Interactively, WORD defaults to the headword of the Latin entry at point;
with a prefix argument, prompt for it.  The entry behaves like any other
lookup: `C-c C-n' and `C-c C-p' walk the dictionary, `C-c C-c' on a word
returns to Lewis & Short, and the print-dictionary banner opens the OLD,
the TLL and Gaffiot.

A word Georges does not have produces the nearest entry, with a message
saying so, exactly as Lewis & Short does.

With only `diogenes-georges-directory' set and no XML converted, Georges is
simply a print dictionary like the OLD, and this command opens the page
rather than explaining what is not installed.

Pressed a second time, from INSIDE the entry it has just shown, it opens
that word's page in the printed Handwörterbuch instead -- see
`diogenes-lookup-open-georges-pdf'.  `C-u G' looks another word up in the
XML from there.

Requires either a converted dictionary file (see
\\[diogenes-georges-build-dictionary]) or the printed volumes."
