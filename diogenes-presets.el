;;; Commentary:

;; A preset is an ordinary Emacs Lisp file that sets Diogenes options.  There
;; is nothing else to it: `load' is what loads it, and anything you could
;; write in an init file you can write in one.
;;
;;     ;;; reading.el --- Diogenes preset
;;     ;; Description: entries beside the text, dictionaries in their own frame
;;     (setq diogenes-window-behaviour 'split)
;;     (setq diogenes-lookup-show-all-entries t)
;;
;; Put it in `diogenes-preset-directory' and `M-x diogenes-load-preset' offers
;; it by name, with that Description line as the annotation.
;;
;; Why a directory of files rather than more options.  The settings a reader
;; wants are not one set but several, and which they want depends on what they
;; are doing: a preset for reading at length, a preset for looking one word up
;; in the middle of writing, a preset for the machine with the small screen.
;; Those differ in a dozen variables at once, which is not a thing a defcustom
;; can express, and shuffling them by hand in an init file loses whichever one
;; is not currently pasted in.
;;
;; Nothing here validates or restricts what a preset may set.  It is Lisp, it
;; is yours, and a preset that sets `line-spacing' or turns off a minor mode
;; is doing something reasonable.

(defcustom diogenes-preset-directory nil
  "Directory holding preset files, or nil for none.
Each `.el\=' file in it is a preset, offered by `M-x diogenes-load-preset\='
under its file name.

Nil by default, because a reader needs no directory in order to have presets:
the four behaviours are presets already, and are offered whether this is set
or not.  Set it when there is something of your own to keep -- the same
arrangement the dictionaries have, where an unset path means one fewer thing
rather than a broken one."

    ("frames" . "each kind in a frame of its own, entries gathered"))
  "The four behaviours, offered as presets.
An alist of (NAME . DESCRIPTION), each NAME a value of
`diogenes-window-behaviour\='; loading one sets that and nothing else.

Here so that presets work with nothing written and no directory set.  What a
reader most often wants to switch between is exactly these four, and asking
them to write four files saying one thing each would be a poor beginning.

A FILE of the same name in `diogenes-preset-directory\=' REPLACES the builtin:
`split.el\=' of your own is then what `split\=' means, and the builtin steps
aside rather than arguing with it."

The file name without its extension, as `M-x diogenes-load-preset\\=' shows it.

Loaded AFTER the package, so a preset can set anything the package defines --
and after an init file has had its say, so a preset wins over it.  That order
is deliberate: an init file holds what is true of this machine, a preset what
is true of what you are doing now, and the second is the more particular."
