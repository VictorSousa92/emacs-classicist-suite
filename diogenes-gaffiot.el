;;; Commentary:

;; Show the entry of Félix Gaffiot's _Dictionnaire illustré latin-français_
;; for the Latin word you are reading -- in a Diogenes lookup buffer, not a
;; PDF.  From a Latin entry (Lewis & Short), press `g' or click the
;; "[Gaffiot]" link.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHY THIS IS NOT LIKE THE PRINT-DICTIONARY MODULES
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; `diogenes-old.el' and its siblings jump a scanned PDF to a page.  Gaffiot
;; comes as TEI XML instead, entry by entry, exactly the kind of thing
;; `classicist-lookup-mode' already displays for the LSJ and Lewis & Short.  So
;; this module adds no display machinery of its own: it hands Gaffiot to
;; `classicist--search-dict' as one more dictionary file, and everything the
;; lookup buffer can do comes with it --
;;
;;   * `C-c C-n' / `C-c C-p' walk to the next and previous entry;
;;   * `C-c C-c' on a word looks it up: a Latin word goes to Lewis & Short,
;;     so you can step from Gaffiot back into the electronic Latin
;;     dictionary, and Greek inside an entry (Gaffiot quotes plenty) goes to
;;     the LSJ;
;;   * the print dictionaries are one keystroke away, since the entry carries
;;     the usual "[OLD] [TLL]" banner;
;;   * every entry opens in a fresh buffer, so the Lewis & Short entry you
;;     came from stays live and reachable.
;;
;; Either source will do on its own, and together they divide the work:
;;
;;   * XML only -- entries for whatever the file covers, and a word it does
;;     not have reports that the file goes no further;
;;   * PDF only (`diogenes-gaffiot-pdf-file\') -- Gaffiot behaves like the
;;     other print dictionaries, opening the page for any word;
;;   * both -- the XML entry where there is one, the printed page otherwise.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; THE DICTIONARY FILE
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Diogenes looks a word up by binary search over a file of ONE ENTRY PER
;; LINE, sorted by an ASCII `key' attribute (see `classicist--binary-search'
;; and `classicist--ascii-sort-function').  The Gaffiot TEI is a single
;; document with entries spread over many lines and headwords full of
;; macrons, so it has to be converted once:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-gaffiot-source-file "/path/to/gaffiot-unicode.xml")
;;   M-x diogenes-gaffiot-build-dictionary
;;
;; which writes `gaffiot.xml' beside the other Diogenes dictionaries.  Each
;; entry becomes one line, its first <orth> becomes the <head> the formatter
;; recognises as a headword, and its key is that headword reduced to ASCII
;; letters -- macrons and breves stripped, æ and œ expanded, the homograph
;; numeral of \"1 ăbactus\" dropped -- so that the keys Lewis & Short sends
;; us match.  Offered automatically the first time you press `g' with no
;; dictionary file present.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; COVERAGE
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Mind which Gaffiot you have; there are two, and they trade completeness
;; against the work of getting there.
;;
;;   * The FDB database published at Zurich
;;     (https://www.iaka.uzh.ch/de/klph/it/mls.html) is COMPLETE, A to Z,
;;     but is a database rather than TEI, so it has to be converted before
;;     it can be converted again into the one-entry-per-line form here.
;;   * The TEI at https://digital-gaffiot.sourceforge.net/ is ALREADY TEI
;;     and needs no such step, but is proofread as far as F only (some
;;     28 000 entries).
;;
;; Nothing here assumes either.  A word the file does not have is not
;; missing from Gaffiot, merely from the file, so rather than show the
;; nearest entry and call it a near miss this module asks whether the key is
;; there exactly (`diogenes-gaffiot--entry-exists-p') and, failing that,
;; sends the word to the printed dictionary or says the file goes no
;; further.  With the complete database converted, the question never
;; arises.

Interactively, WORD defaults to the headword of the Latin entry at point;
with a prefix argument, prompt for it.  The entry behaves like any other
lookup: `C-c C-n' and `C-c C-p' walk the dictionary, `C-c C-c' on a Latin
word returns to Lewis & Short and on a Greek one goes to the LSJ, and the
\"[OLD] [TLL]\" banner opens the print dictionaries.

A word the XML does not cover -- it is proofread only as far as F --
opens the printed dictionary instead, when `diogenes-gaffiot-pdf-file' is
set; see `diogenes-gaffiot-pdf-fallback'.  Pressed a second time, from
INSIDE the entry it has just shown, it opens that word's page in the
printed Gaffiot -- as `B' does in Bailly and `G' in Georges -- and `C-u g'
looks another word up in the XML from there.  The two sources then cover the
whole alphabet between them.
