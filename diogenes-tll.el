;;; Commentary:

;; This module lets you jump from a Diogenes dictionary entry (the
;; buffer produced by `classicist-lookup-mode') straight to the page of
;; the *Thesaurus Linguae Latinae* (TLL) that contains that entry,
;; displayed inside Emacs with `pdf-tools' (or, as a fallback,
;; `doc-view').  It is the TLL counterpart of `diogenes-old.el' and
;; reuses that module's headword normalization and PDF-display code.
;;
;; Unlike the OLD, the TLL is distributed as *many* PDFs, one per
;; fascicle, as downloaded from the Bayerische Akademie der
;; Wissenschaften.  Two facts about those files make everything work
;; with no pre-built data and no Perl:
;;
;;   1. Each file NAME states the interval of words the fascicle
;;      covers, e.g.
;;        "ThLL vol. 06.1 col. 0001-0808 (f-firmitas).pdf"
;;      The parenthetical "(f-firmitas)" tells us this fascicle runs
;;      from the headword "f" to "firmitas".  We route a headword to the
;;      correct fascicle by finding the file whose interval contains it.
;;
;;   2. Inside each fascicle every headword is a bookmark in the PDF
;;      outline (several per page).  Once the fascicle is chosen we look
;;      the headword up in that outline for its exact page.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-tll-pdf-directory "/path/to/TLL/")
;;
;; Then, in a lookup buffer, press `t' or click the "[TLL]" link shown
;; at the top of each Latin entry.
