A text may divide a word at the end of a line, and `C-c C-c\=' on either half
looked up that half -- `praeci\=' and `pitur\=' rather than `praecipitur\=', neither
of which any dictionary has.

It was off for a while, having shipped broken.  The first version read the wrong
text property -- the citation printed at the head of a line is marked
`diogenes-citation\=', not `cit\=', which is on the text -- and so took the
citation's own digits for the second half of the word: `captan-\=' followed by
`10.20.2.4 tem spiritus liquit\=' was looked up as `captan10\='.  With the citations
hidden it was worse: the loop that skipped them could not advance and Emacs
hung.

Both are mended and confirmed in use, in the Greek and the Latin both --
`captantem\=' in Seneca, `singulos\=' in a PHI text whose citation has four levels
-- so the default is on.  A reader meeting a divided word wants the word, and
having to know that an option exists before `C-c C-c\=' will find it is a poor
bargain for a fault that no longer happens.

Only where the buffer SAYS the word is divided: a hyphen at the end of the line,
or the record `C-c C--\=' leaves behind when it removes one.  A line merely
ending in the middle of a phrase is not evidence, and guessing there would join
two ordinary words as often as it mended a broken one.

The halves are joined for the lookup only; the buffer is not touched.

Or the record `classicist-browser-remove-hyphenation\=' leaves when it removes one:
it puts `hyphen-start\=' on the line that held the first half and `hyphen-end\=' on
the line that held the second, with the halves as their values.  So a buffer
whose hyphens have been removed still knows where they were, and a word already
joined in the text needs nothing done to it -- the property is how we can tell
that case from a word that was never divided at all.

A line that merely ends in the middle of a phrase is NOT evidence.  An earlier
draft guessed there, on the grounds that the next line began lower-case, and
