;;; Commentary:

;; Jump from a Diogenes *Greek* dictionary entry (the buffer produced by
;; `classicist-lookup-mode') to the page of Henri Estienne's (Stephanus's)
;; _Thesaurus Graecae Linguae_ (TGL / TLG, the 1572 folio in the
;; Bayerische Staatsbibliothek scans) that contains that entry, shown in
;; the volume's PDF with `pdf-tools' (or `doc-view').  It is the Greek
;; counterpart of `diogenes-passow.el' and reuses that module's Greek
;; collation key and PDF-display driver.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; WHY THE TGL NEEDS ITS OWN MODULE
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The TGL is organised ETYMOLOGICALLY, not strictly alphabetically: a
;; root word is a main entry (printed in FULL CAPITALS at the left
;; margin), and its morphological/derivational relatives are nested
;; UNDER it as sub-entries (printed with a single leading capital).  So
;; e.g. διαλέγω is found under λέγω, and κάμψις under κάμπτω.  A plain
;; "find the running head" search -- which works for an alphabetical
;; dictionary like Passow or the OLD -- therefore does NOT reliably lead
;; to a derived word, because that word never heads a page.
;;
;; Fortunately the last (fifth) volume ends with a COMPREHENSIVE INDEX
;; that lists (very nearly) every word -- roots AND derivatives -- each
;; with a pointer of the form
;;
;;     <word>, t.<volume>, c.<column>, <section-letter>
;;
;; e.g. "Αβαξ, τ.1, c.1, b" or (OCR-mangled) "Αβασανισος, 1.1.0.723.8".
;; Those pointers are to the PRINTED book (tomus + column), NOT to PDF
;; pages, so we must translate them.
;;
;; This module therefore looks a word up in TWO stages:
;;
;;   1. ENTRY OPENING (caps).  The root entries are printed in FULL
;;      CAPITALS at the left margin, so the first page on which a word's
;;      all-caps headword appears is the true opening of its article.
;;      We build, per volume, a map from each caps headword to that
;;      first page and consult it FIRST -- it beats the index for long
;;      roots, whose index column often points into the middle of the
;;      article (the index sends ἔχω to a column about eleven pages past
;;      where ΕΧΩ actually begins).
;;
;;   2. INDEX (exact).  Otherwise parse the index in volume V, find the
;;      word by an exact headword match, read its (volume, column), and
;;      translate the column to a PDF page of that volume.
;;
;;   3. CROSS-REFERENCE HOP.  Many nested words carry no column of their
;;      own but an index line "vide in <root>" (e.g. "Αδενοειδής … vide
;;      in Αδήν").  We resolve the named root (by its caps opening, else
;;      the index) and use its location.
;;
;;   4. MORPHOLOGICAL FALLBACK.  A bare compound the index neither
;;      columns nor cross-references (e.g. διαλέγω under λέγω,
;;      καταλαμβάνω under λαμβάνω) is decomposed by stripping ONE leading
;;      prefix per Smyth, Greek Grammar Sections 870, 884-885 -- undoing
;;      the vowel contraction/lengthening at the seam (Sections 884 b,
;;      887) so δια+λεγω's surface αλεγω is reduced to the true root
;;      λεγω -- and the root is resolved by its caps opening or an EXACT
;;      index hit.  A small explicit table also maps specific
;;      REDUPLICATED presents to their root (e.g. πιφαύσκω -> φάω), since
;;      those are filed under a root in another volume that no
;;      letter-based route or general prefix rule could reach safely.
;;      Conservative and gated so it adds coverage without manufacturing
;;      cross-volume errors.
;;
;;   5. INDEX (fuzzy).  Only now, as a lower-priority attempt, a 1-edit
;;      fuzzy index match (for a word whose own headword the OCR
;;      garbled), accepted only when its volume agrees with the letter
;;      the word begins with -- so a garbled near-miss of another volume
;;      cannot hijack the lookup, and cannot outrank a real entry
;;      opening found above.
;;
;;   6. BODY FALLBACK.  Finally, scan the volumes' OCR for the word as a
;;      left-margin entry -- the Passow technique -- routing to the
;;      right volume by the letter each volume covers.  This reaches
;;      sub-lemmata (printed with a single leading capital) too.
;;
;; KNOWN LIMITATION.  A truly nested compound that has NO caps entry of
;; its own, NO index column, NO "vide" line, and NO strippable prefix
;; whose root resolves cannot be placed under its root with certainty --
;; nothing in the OCR records where Estienne filed it.  For such a word
;; the body scan lands in its own alphabetical neighbourhood, and the
;; running head lets the reader adjust.  This is inherent to a
;; page-image navigation aid over an etymologically-nested lexicon and
;; noisy OCR, and does not affect the many words handled by stages 1-5.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; COLUMN  ->  PDF PAGE
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; The TGL folio is paginated by COLUMN, two columns to a physical page,
;; and each OCR page carries its two column numbers at the top, right
;; after the "----- N / TOTAL -----" delimiter, e.g.
;;
;;     ----- 57 / 1034 -----
;;     1
;;     2
;;     ...
;;
;; so PDF page 57 of volume I holds columns 1-2, page 58 holds 3-4, and
;; so on.  The left column L on a page satisfies  L = 2*PDF + b  for an
;; intercept b that is constant within a run and jumps only at an
;; inserted (unnumbered) plate -- a "seam" that shifts every following
;; page.  We exploit that fixed slope of 2 to derive the pagination from
;; its own structure rather than trusting scattered anchors:
;;
;;   * ORIGIN.  Each volume opens with front matter (often numbered in
;;     Roman numerals) before the arabic column count begins at cols 1-2
;;     (or 5-6).  We find the PDF page of arabic column 1 by EXTRAPOLATION
;;     -- since L = 2*PDF + b, each early anchor implies the origin page,
;;     and we take the modal implied origin -- so a leading "1" the OCR
;;     glued onto the Greek header does not matter.
;;   * SEAMS.  Walking the anchors in column order, we open a new segment
;;     only where several consecutive anchors agree on a new intercept b,
;;     so a single garbled column cannot invent a false seam and a genuine
;;     plate is carried forward for all later columns.
;;
;; The result is a PIECEWISE slope-2 model -- a list of (START-COLUMN . b)
;; segments -- and a column maps to  floor((COLUMN - b) / 2)  under its
;; segment.  This is robust to a garbled anchor (an outlier b that never
;; forms a segment) and to a page whose own anchor is missing (its
;; segment's line still places it).  No pre-built data and no Perl are
;; needed: everything is parsed from the OCR text shipped with each
;; volume.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; ACCURACY AND ONE KNOWN LIMITATION
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; On genuine (cleanly-OCR'd) headwords this lands on the correct
;; volume about nine times in ten, and on the exact column-page for the
;; large majority; the misses are dominated by OCR noise -- a garbled
;; headword the fuzzy step cannot repair, or a very short key that
;; collides with a homograph in another volume.  It is a navigation aid,
;; not an oracle: you arrive on the right page (or its immediate
;; neighbour), read the running head, and nudge if need be.
;;
;; The genuinely unsolvable case is a NESTED COMPOUND that the index
;; records with NEITHER a column of its own NOR a "vide in <root>"
;; pointer -- a bare derivative like διαλέγω, printed only under λέγω.
;; Nothing in the OCR marks that "διαλέγω lives under λέγω": the
;; relationship exists solely in the editors' heads and the physical
;; nesting.  For such a word the best any method can do is route by its
;; own initial letter, so this module lands you in the δια- neighbourhood
;; rather than under λέγω.  Words that DO get an index column or a "vide"
;; cross-reference -- the great majority of derivatives -- are found.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; DIRECTORY LAYOUT
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; A single parent folder (say TGL/) holds one sub-directory per volume,
;; named with the volume's Roman numeral exactly as the tomus is
;; numbered:
;;
;;     TGL/
;;       I/     <- tomus 1 : PDF + OCR .txt   (Α … Δ)
;;       II/    <- tomus 2 : PDF + OCR .txt   (Ε … Ο)
;;       III/   <- tomus 3 : PDF + OCR .txt   (Π … Υ)
;;       IIII/  <- tomus 4 : PDF + OCR .txt   (Φ … Ω)
;;       V/     <- tomus 5 : PDF + OCR .txt   (dialects appendix + INDEX)
;;
;; Each sub-directory contains that volume's PDF and an OCR text file
;; whose pages are delimited by "----- N / TOTAL -----" lines.  The
;; folder name is the sole source of the tomus number, so the index's
;; "t.<n>" pointers map straight onto folder <Roman-numeral-of-n>.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-tgl-directory "/path/to/TGL/")   ; the parent folder
;;
;; Then, in a Greek lookup buffer, press `T' or click the "[TGL]" link.

;;;; ROUTING BY INITIAL LETTER
;;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------

;; A word's own entry lives in the volume covering its initial letter, so
;; correct letter->volume routing is fundamental (it decides which
;; volume's index references and body pages count as the word's own).
;; The TGL's four content volumes divide the alphabet in fixed, well
;; known blocks; we nonetheless DERIVE the split from the scans so it
;; adapts to a differently-cut set -- but from the ROBUST signal (how
;; many all-caps root entries each volume devotes to each initial
;; letter), not the fragile page-backbone histogram used before, which
;; could be swayed by quoted Greek and mis-route a letter (that bug sent
;; λέγω, a λ/tomus-2 word, into tomus 3).  The canonical block partition
;; is used as the tiebreak/fallback so routing stays correct even for a
;; volume whose OCR is too degraded to vote.

;;     vowels contract at the seam (Section 884 b) and the element's short
;;     initial vowel lengthens (Section 887: alpha/epsilon -> eta, omicron -> omega).
;;     So after stripping such a prefix we also peel the leftover leading
;;     vowel of the remainder and try de-lengthened forms (omega->omicron,
;;     eta->epsilon/alpha) -- this is what turns δια+λεγω's surface αλεγω
;;     into the real root λεγω.  Consonant-final prefixes leave a clean
;;     remainder and get no extra peel.
;;
;; This is deliberately CONSERVATIVE and safe:
;;   - at most ONE prefix is stripped (no chasing δι-έξ-οδο-ς, Section 869);
;;   - a candidate is accepted ONLY on an EXACT index hit -- never fuzzy,
;;     so an OCR-garbled near-miss cannot masquerade as a root;
;;   - both the stripped word's residual AND the root candidate must be at
;;     least `diogenes-tgl-morph-min-root' letters, which removes the
;;     short-word collisions (e.g. stripping alpha off ἀθήρ to reach θηρ, or
;;     ευ off εὐδία to reach δια);
;;   - the whole stage runs only AFTER index (exact + fuzzy) and the vide
;;     hop have failed, so it never overrides a more reliable result.
;; A wrong-but-surviving decomposition is almost always in the same volume
;; the word's own initial letter routes to, so it cannot cause a
;; cross-volume error; it merely picks a (usually nearby) page there.

enough to be unique to its verb family, mapped to the collation key of
a root that (a) is in the right volume and (b) resolves cleanly (has a
caps opening or an exact index reference).  For the πιφαύσκω/πιφάσκω
group the mapped root is φάσκω: Estienne prints \"ΦΑΣΚΩ, … & per
reduplicationem Πιφαύσκω\" as the headword of the very entry that then
discusses πιφαύσκω at length (t.IIII), and ΦΑΣΚΩ is captured as a caps

volume that letter routes to (`diogenes-tgl--tomus-for-key').  Any
reference to the word from a DIFFERENT volume comes from a derived
word that lives there (e.g. the alpha-privative ἀλογία mentions
λόγος while pointing into the alpha volume) and is at best an
approximate hint, never the root's location.  We therefore keep only
the references whose volume matches KEY's letter-routed volume; if
none remain, the index does not actually contain this word's own
entry and we return nil (the caller then tries caps/body, or the
cross-volume hint as a last resort).  Among the kept references we
take the SMALLEST column, which is the entry's opening (a larger
column for the same word is a later subsection).

An exact headword match and a 1-edit fuzzy match are handled the
same way -- both are subject to the volume filter -- so a garbled
fuzzy hit belonging to another volume is naturally discarded.  With

     `caps'.  A caps headword is the first line of its article, so
     this is the true entry opening -- preferred over an index column,
     which for long roots often points mid-article.
  2. INDEX, EXACT reference in WORD's own (letter-routed) volume, at
     its smallest column (the entry opening)                -> :via `index';
  3. INDEX, FUZZY reference in WORD's own volume             -> :via `index';
  4. INDEX \"vide in <root>\" cross-reference (one hop)     -> :via `xref';
  5. MORPHOLOGY: strip one prefix, resolve the root by its
     caps opening or an exact own-volume index hit          -> :via `morph';
  6. BODY scan by initial letter                            -> :via `body';
  7. CROSS-VOLUME index HINT (references from derived words in
     other volumes) -- approximate only                     -> :via `hint'.

The word's OWN index entry -- whether matched exactly (2) or through
a 1-edit OCR wobble in its headword (3) -- ranks ABOVE the vide (4)
and morphological (5) paths, because those only INFER where a related
root sits, whereas an own-volume index reference is the word's own
entry.  Steps 2, 3 and 5 keep only references whose volume matches
WORD's own initial letter, since a root's entry is filed under its
own letter; a reference from another volume belongs to a derived word
and is demoted to the approximate step 7.

The plist always has :tomus and :page.  Index/xref/morph hits add
:column, :letter and :match (`exact'/`fuzzy') when applicable; xref
and morph hits also add :root (the collation key jumped through);
the step-7 hint adds :column.  Returns nil only when WORD is found by
none of these and its volume/letter is uninstalled."

;; Building every TGL cache from the OCR (column models, index, per-volume
;; compound/vnde/entry/body/header maps, letter map) takes several seconds
;; the first time in a session.  `diogenes-tgl-build-index' does it once and
;; writes a PORTABLE snapshot -- `tgl-index.eld' in the parent folder -- that
;; any machine with the same OCR can load instantly, so the OCR is never
;; parsed at look-up time.
;;
;; Portability trick: the live caches are keyed by each file's truename+mtime
;; (machine-specific), so we do NOT store those keys.  We store each cached
;; value under a PORTABLE role key -- the tomus number for per-volume caches,
;; `:all' for the whole-set letter map -- and on load we re-key each value to
;; THIS machine's current truename+mtime for that volume.  The live caches
;; and their accessors are therefore untouched; the snapshot simply adopts
;; local keys when loaded.  Hash-table values are written with Emacs's
;; readable `#s(hash-table ...)' syntax (print-length/level nil), so no
;; per-field conversion is needed.
