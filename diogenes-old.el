;;; Commentary:

;; This module lets you jump from a Diogenes dictionary entry (the
;; buffer produced by `classicist-lookup-mode', i.e. after you look up or
;; parse a Latin word) straight to the page of the *Oxford Latin
;; Dictionary* (OLD) that contains that entry, displayed inside Emacs
;; with `pdf-tools' (or, as a fallback, `doc-view').
;;
;; It works with any OLD PDF that carries an outline / table of contents
;; whose bookmarks are the printed running heads (guide words) of each
;; page -- which is exactly what the OLD's first edition has, and what
;; the upstream Diogenes build tools rely on.  No pre-built data file and
;; no Perl round-trip are needed: the page index is read directly from
;; the PDF's own outline via `pdf-info-outline'.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-old-pdf-file "/path/to/OLD.pdf")
;;
;; Then, in a lookup buffer, press `o' or click the "[OLD]" link shown at
;; the top of each entry.
;;
;; If your PDF's page labels are offset from the physical page numbers
;; (common with scans that include unnumbered front matter), set
;; `diogenes-old-page-offset' to the difference, or -- more robustly --
;; just rely on the outline, whose destinations are always physical
;; pages and therefore already correct.

;;; Code:
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'seq)
(require 'ucs-normalize)
(require 'diogenes-lisp-utils)          ; classicist--require-path, --path-usable-p

;; Called across files that cannot be required from here without a
;; cycle, and -- where the name is one of this package's own caches --
;; defined inside a `let', which the compiler does not count as a
;; definition at all.

  "If non-nil, show the dictionary PDF in another window.
The default is nil: the page appears in the window the lookup was made
from, replacing the entry.  Closing the document buffer brings the entry
back, so a lookup and the print dictionary it opens share one window
instead of splitting the frame for a page you will read and close.

A non-nil `pop-up-frames' overrides this: asking for a frame of its own
is asking for another window, so the page is displayed rather than put in
the entry\'s place, and lands in a new frame (the next dictionary then
joins it -- see `diogenes-old-reader-reuse-document-frame').  Unset
`pop-up-frames' and the page replaces the entry again.

Set it to t for the side-by-side arrangement of the original Diogenes
desktop application, which shows the dictionary text and the PDF page at
once.  Which window, or frame, the page then goes to is decided by
`diogenes-old-pdf-display-action' and
`diogenes-old-reader-reuse-document-frame' under the Emacs Reader, and by
`display-buffer' (with window-purpose, if you use it) otherwise.

Passow and the TGL bind this to their own equivalents; see
`diogenes-passow-display-in-other-window' and
`diogenes-tgl-display-in-other-window'.

Left as it is, and not folded into `diogenes-window-behaviour': this says
whether the page goes somewhere other than the window it was asked for from,
which is a question about the printed dictionaries rather than about where
Diogenes buffers go.  Where it sends the page elsewhere,
`diogenes-dictionary-display-action' and `diogenes-window-behaviour' decide

Comes AFTER the document reuse, so a dictionary still joins a dictionary

not chosen by accident.

Declines entirely when `pop-up-frames\=' is set.  There the reader has asked

  "`display-buffer' ACTION for showing a dictionary page.
Two ways of reusing a window and no third: the window already showing THIS
document, then any window showing a document at all -- `reader-mode',
`pdf-view-mode', `doc-view-mode', per the `mode' entry.  So one dictionary
after another replaces the page on screen instead of splitting the frame
again.

Then, failing both, the window showing the ENTRY -- see
`diogenes-old-display-in-lookup-window'.  A dictionary belongs beside the
question it answers, and `q' brings the entry back to that window.

There is deliberately no `display-buffer-use-some-window' here, and that
matters more than it looks.  It takes ANY window, and the browser's is a
window: with purpose in charge this action was never reached, and without
purpose it sent the first dictionary into the frame the text was being read
in.  A dictionary should land on a dictionary, or on the entry, or nowhere --
with none of the three, the list is exhausted and `display-buffer' falls back
to its own behaviour, which is what honours `pop-up-frames'.

`reusable-frames' is `visible' because the reuse functions otherwise look at
the selected frame alone: with `pop-up-frames' non-nil, or any setup where
the dictionary ends up in a frame of its own, the window holding it would
not be found and a further frame would be created for every dictionary.
Set it to nil to keep the search to one frame.

`pop-up-frames' and `display-buffer-alist' would put it -- a frame of its
own, if that is your setting -- and each dictionary after it replaces the
page in that same window, for as long as some visible frame still shows a
document buffer.  Close it and the next dictionary opens a fresh frame
again.

Two things have to give way for that.  The Reader's entry point
`reader-open-doc' DISPLAYS the document as part of loading it, before
Diogenes has any say in where it goes, and `save-window-excursion' cannot
take a new frame back -- it restores the window configuration of a frame,
not the set of frames.  So when a document window exists, `pop-up-frames'
is bound to nil for the duration of the open (the Reader\'s own display
then lands on the selected frame, where `save-window-excursion' does undo
it) and of the display that follows, which goes through
`diogenes-old-pdf-display-action'.

A page's guide word is its last headword, and the OLD\'s OCR sometimes
drops a headword\'s final letters -- `uadimoni\' for UADIMONIUM -- so a
clipped guide word sorts just before the full word and the plain search
steps past its page.  But a guide word can also be a prefix of a later
word by being a perfectly good headword in its own right: RECENS heads a
page, RECENSEO begins the next, and nothing in the bookmark text tells
the two cases apart.

  `dictionary\' (the default) asks Lewis & Short whether the guide word is
    itself a headword.  RECENS is; the clipped `uadimoni\' is not.  This
    needs no text layer in the scan -- only the electronic dictionary
    Diogenes already searches -- and costs one binary search.
  `verify\'     reads the candidate page and takes it only if the word is
    printed there.  Decisive when the scan HAS a text layer, useless when
    it has none (it then behaves as nil).
  t          assumes a truncation, as this module always did: right for
    UADIMONIUM, a page early for RECENSEO.
  nil        never assumes one: right for RECENSEO, a page late for
    UADIMONIUM.

A page late or early is not fatal -- the running head tells you which way
to step -- but the first two settings are right in both cases, as far as
their evidence reaches.  A guide word Lewis & Short happens not to carry

For the Emacs Reader specifically, `display-buffer-overriding-action'

such an overriding action, and when it intercepts the Reader's display
the Reader's render pipeline does not run, so its page overlay is never

fixes that.  This binding is scoped to the Reader case only, so
pdf-tools, doc-view, and window-purpose's handling of every other
buffer (lookups, browser) are unaffected.

Taking purpose out of the loop costs one thing, though: it is purpose
that otherwise keeps one dictionary after another in a single window,
so without it each dictionary opened a new one.  The Reader case
therefore displays through `diogenes-old-pdf-display-action', which
reuses a window already showing a document buffer.  While a dictionary
is on screen, `pop-up-frames' is bound to nil so that neither the
Reader\'s own display nor this one moves the next dictionary to a frame
