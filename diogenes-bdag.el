;;; Commentary:

;; This module lets you jump from a Diogenes *Greek* dictionary entry
;; (the buffer produced by `classicist-lookup-mode') to the page of BDAG
;; -- Bauer's _Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament_ (Bauer,
;; Danker, Arndt, Gingrich) -- that contains that entry, displayed with
;; `pdf-tools' (or `doc-view').  It is a Greek counterpart of
;; `diogenes-old.el' and reuses that module's PDF display code, and it
;; shares the accent-insensitive Greek collation key with the Montanari
;; module (`diogenes-montanari--greek-key').
;;
;; The BDAG PDF is bookmarked with one HEADWORD INTERVAL per page, in
;; the form "<n>: <first> - <last>", e.g.
;;
;;   2: ἀβροχία - ἀγαθός
;;   3: ἀγαθότης - ἀγαλλίασις
;;
;; Pages that begin a letter, or that are wholly taken up by one long
;; entry, carry a single word instead of an interval (e.g. "5: ἀγάπη",
;; "290: ἐν"); such a word is treated as both bounds of the page.
;;
;; Unlike the Montanari scan, BDAG's bookmark text is clean, accented
;; Unicode Greek, so a word is matched to the page whose interval
;; CONTAINS it (first <= word <= last); words falling in a gap use the
;; nearest preceding page.  Matching is accent- and case-insensitive.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (setq diogenes-bdag-pdf-file "/path/to/BDAG.pdf")
;;
;; Then, in a Greek lookup buffer, press `d' or click the "[BDAG]" link.
