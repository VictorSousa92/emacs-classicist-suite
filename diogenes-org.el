;;; Commentary:

;; Org links to what Diogenes shows: a passage of a text, an entry in a
;; dictionary, a page of a scanned one.  `C-c l' in a Diogenes buffer stores a
;; link; `C-c C-o' on it in an org file opens the thing again.
;;
;;     [[diogenes:passage:tlg:0086:025:1053a.15-1053a.18][Arist. Metaph. 1053a15-18]]
;;     [[diogenes:entry:greek:le/gw][λέγω, LSJ]]
;;     [[diogenes:page:old:1283][OLD p. 1283]]
;;
;; ONE LINK TYPE with a discriminator, rather than three types.  A reader
;; writing an org file has one thing to remember, and the second field says what
;; kind of thing is meant.
;;
;; THE TARGET IS NOT THE DESCRIPTION.  A citation as a scholar writes it --
;; `1053a15', the Bekker page running into the line -- cannot be read back:
;; nothing in the string says where the page ends, and knowing would mean
;; knowing the work's levels before parsing the citation that identifies the
;; work.  So the target carries `1053a.15', a stop between every level, and the
;; description carries the conventional form.  The part that must function does
;; not depend on any convention.
;;
;; REQUIRES the fork at https://github.com/VictorSousa92/diogenes.el, branch
;; `org-integration'.  `classicist-browser-reference', `classicist-open-passage' and
;; the abbreviation table are not in the upstream package; this is built on
;; them, and on nothing private -- `classicist--browse-work' has two hyphens and
;; is none of our business.

;;; Code:

(require 'org)

;; NOT `(require \='diogenes)\='.  Loading the whole package runs its startup
;; check, which signals `diogenes-path is not set!\=' -- right for a reader who
;; has not configured it, and fatal to a batch compile, which has no
;; configuration at all.
;;
;; Nothing here needs Diogenes at compile time either: every function used is
;; declared below and called at run time, when a reader is in a Diogenes buffer
;; and Diogenes is therefore loaded.  The `eval-when-compile\=' is for the macros
;; and the mode symbols only.
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
(require 'seq)

;; Diogenes' own, called at run time.  Declared rather than required, so this
;; file compiles without a configured Diogenes and fails only where it should:
;; at the point a reader asks for something Diogenes has to answer.
