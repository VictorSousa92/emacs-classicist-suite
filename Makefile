## diogenes-archive.el IS NOT COMPILED, and that is deliberate.  It is

## failed at the first call without cl-lib, and nothing ever made that call.
## Compiling it produces twelve warnings about functions that no longer
## exist, which is twelve pieces of noise about a file that does nothing.
##
## Left in the tree rather than deleted, because deleting it is a decision
## about what is worth keeping and git has it either way.

## ANYTHING DEFINED IN MORE THAN ONE FILE, which nothing else here sees.  The
## forms checker reads one file at a time, the compiler takes whichever
## loaded last, and check-declare reads declarations, not definitions.
##
## classicist--lookup-headword was defvar-local in one file and a plain
## defvar in another, both docstrings claiming buffer-local and only one
## making it so -- which won depended on the load order.  Nine other files
## declared it by hand believing there was one definition.
##
## A duplicate is visible while both copies sit in one file, where the forms
## checker calls it "defined twice", and invisible the moment a cut separates
## them.  So this runs after every cut, not once.

## THE RATCHET, AND NOT A ZERO.  tei-browser fails on a single warning
## because that file is at zero and can stay there.  This package is at 154
## across forty files, most of it inherited, and a gate demanding zero would
## be switched off within a day.  So the gate is per file and against the
## recorded count: a file may get better and may not get worse.
##
## PER FILE AND NOT FOR THE TREE, because a tree total is not trustworthy.
## batch-byte-compile works alphabetically in one Emacs, and a `require' loads
## the required file AS SOURCE -- so one file silences another's warnings.  It
## happened three times during the extractions, once hiding the very bug two
## upstream patches then fixed.
## AN ERROR IS NOT ZERO WARNINGS, and this counted it as such.  The recipe
## used to pipe the compile straight into `grep -c Warning': a file that
## fails to compile prints an error and no warnings, so the count came out
## zero, which is less than whatever the baseline said -- and the ratchet
## announced
##
##     better diogenes-perseus.el: 40 -> 0   (make baseline)
##
## for a file that would not compile.  Three at once, and it read as the best
## result of the evening.  Worse than blind: inverted, and inviting `make
## baseline' to write the zero down as the standard.
##
## So the output is taken ONCE, checked for `error' before anything is
## counted, and only then compared.  Taking it once also halves the work: the
## old recipe compiled every worse file a second time to print its warnings.

## EVERY `declare-function', AGAINST THE DEFINITION IT NAMES.  Forty were
## wrong when this was first run: six named the wrong file, fifteen gave an
## arglist a cl-defun with keywords cannot have, one was malformed with `nil'
## in the file slot, and one named an obsolete alias.
##
## And one was a BROKEN COMMAND.  `diogenes-georges--locate' was declared and
## called and defined nowhere -- the function is
## `diogenes-georges-pdf--locate' -- so the Georges PDF lookup had never
## worked.  The evidence was in every compile log as `not known to be
## defined', and was read as noise for a day.
##
## `file not found' IS FILTERED: pdf-tools, evil, org-roam and reader are
## optional and are not on this load-path.  Those declarations are correct and
## `check-declare' cannot see them.
