;; READING A DICTIONARY FILE.  A binary search over a sorted index, the file
;; offsets an entry lies between, the beta code the keys are written in, and
;; the XML of an entry turned into something a reader can look at.
;;
;; NINE-TENTHS PRIVATE: twenty-seven of twenty-nine forms are internal, and
;; the rest of what was perseus calls seventeen of them.  Which is the shape
;; of a layer nobody needs to reach into -- you ask it for an entry and it
;; reads the file.
;;
;; IT CALLS NOTHING ABOVE IT except by declaration.
;; `classicist-perseus-action-map' is here, because the XML renderer puts it
;; on every link it makes and the analysis links use it too; the command it
;; names is the dispatcher, which reads a text property and asks the
;; dictionary registry what to run, and that is `classicist-lookup\='s
;; business.  A keymap naming a command it does not define resolves at a
;; keypress, by which time everything is loaded.

;;; Code:

(require 'seq)
(require 'diogenes-perl-interface)      ; --perl-script, perl-executable
(require 'classicist-groups)
(require 'classicist-variants)

;; IN diogenes.el, THE ENTRY POINT, so declared rather than required:

;; exists to avoid.  Upstream patch 5 moved this one down into a

;; cut, and this is the cut.  It wants a home in one of the four.

    o)mi/xlh   o)mi/xlhn   o)mi/xlhs   o)mi/xlh|   o)mi/xlh|sin

`classicist--ascii-sort-function' cannot be used on them, because it
compares `diogenes--ascii-alpha-only' -- accents and breathings thrown
away -- and the two orders disagree wherever one key accents an earlier
syllable than another: the file puts `o)mi/xlh' before `o)mikro/n', while
letters-only makes `omikron' the lesser of the two.  A search then walks
into the wrong half and reports no hit, so a form that IS in the file
fails to parse and the caller falls back to searching the dictionary for
the inflected form itself -- which lands on whatever sorts nearest, one
entry or so away from the word wanted.

The failure is per-bucket, which is what makes it look arbitrary: the
three-character bucket `lo/\=' holds keys accented alike and parses
correctly, while `o)m\=' holds `o)mi/xl-\=', `o)mikr-\=', `o)mo/-\=' and
`o)moi-\=' together and had 55 inversions under the wrong comparator.
