;;; Commentary:

;; HOW A LEMMA IS ASKED FOR, AND WHY IT IS HARD TO ANSWER.  The morphological
;; search -- `l' in the search menu, which is the one search of the corpora
;; that finds a WORD rather than a string -- reads its lemma with
;; `read-from-minibuffer': a plain prompt, no candidates, and the exact lemma
;; or nothing.  So does `diogenes-show-all-forms-greek', and so do the other
;; three word-list commands.
;;
;; That is a hard prompt to answer.  A reader must know, before typing:
;;
;;   * whether the word list spells it `mu/w' or `mu/w1', the trailing digit
;;     distinguishing homographs;
;;   * where the breathing and the accent go -- `e)lpi/s' is not `e(lpi/s'
;;     and not `e)lpis';
;;   * and, in Latin, whether the list carries the macrons: `amo' is stored
;;     `amo_'.
;;
;; Get any of it wrong and the answer is an error, or silence.
;;
;; AND THE LIST IS ALREADY IN MEMORY.  `classicist--get-all-lemmata' reads
;; `greek-lemmata.txt' or `latin-lemmata.txt' into a hash table and caches it.
;; Everything below is a way of letting a reader see into that table while
;; typing, which is what the prompt should have done all along.
;;
;; THE MATCHING RULE, which is the substance of this file: the diacritics one
;; types are the ones one means.
;;
;;   Input with no marks     -> matched against the lemmata with their marks
;;   `muw', `mu'                taken off, so it reaches mu/w, mu/wn, mu/wy
;;                              alike.  The common case, and the one a reader
;;                              who is unsure of the accent needs.
;;
;;   Input with a mark       -> matched as spelled, so `mu/' reaches mu/w and
;;   `mu/w', `μύω'              not mu/wn.  The marks were typed and are
;;                              meant.
;;
;; Greek may be typed as beta code or as Unicode, either way; the input is
;; converted before anything is compared, so the two are one question.
;;
;; WHY A COMPLETION STYLE AND NOT A TABLE.  A table cannot do this on its own
;; under the completion frameworks people run: orderless, which Doom installs,
;; asks the table for everything and then filters the list itself with regexps
;; built from the raw input -- so a table that wanted to match `mu/w' against
;; `μύω' would never be consulted.  A style attached to a CATEGORY is used
;; instead of orderless for that category alone, and leaves every other prompt
;; in Emacs exactly as it was.

;;; The candidates, indexed once and kept on disk

;; WHY A CACHE AT ALL.  `classicist--get-all-lemmata' parses the whole of
;; `greek-lemmata.txt' into a hash table -- every lemma with every attested
;; form and every analysis of it -- and says so while it works, because it
;; takes a while.  For the prompt that is a great deal of work to do before a
;; reader can type the first letter: what the prompt needs is the LEMMATA, and
;; the forms only matter once one has been chosen.
;;
;; SO THIS INDEXES THE FILE ONCE AND WRITES DOWN THREE THINGS PER LEMMA: how
;; the word list spells it, how that reads as Greek, and how it reads with the
;; diacritics off -- the first for the search, the second for the reader, the
;; third for the matching.  Some hundred thousand lines, written as plain text,
;; one lemma to a line, read back with one `insert-file-contents' and a split.
;;
;; AND THE OFFSETS, which is what makes the forms cheap too.  Each lemma's
;; records are somewhere in the file, and the index remembers where -- so the
;; forms of one lemma are got by reading those few hundred bytes rather than
;; the whole file.  It is the same trick Diogenes uses for its dictionaries,
;; which seek to a byte offset and read a line rather than search.
;;
;; THE CACHE IS CHECKED AGAINST THE FILE, by size and modification time, so a
;; new Perseus release is noticed rather than answered from the old index.
;; `diogenes-complete-rebuild' forces it, for a file changed in place within
;; the same second.

;;; Choosing between the records of one lemma

;; WHY THERE IS A SECOND PROMPT AT ALL.  The word list is keyed on the lemma
;; with its homograph digit taken OFF -- `diogenes--lemmata-file-to-hashtable'
;; strips a trailing number -- so one key collects every record spelled that
;; way: `le/gw1' and `le/gw2' are LSJ's two verbs, to gather and to say, and
;; they arrive together under `le/gw'.  `diogenes--lemma-forms-list' then asks
;; which was meant, and asked it with `completing-read' over the processed
;; entries, whose car is the lemma as converted -- which for three records of
;; one spelling is three identical lines.  A choice between indistinguishables
;; is not a choice.
;;
;; SO TWO THINGS HAPPEN HERE.  Records that are the same record -- same full
;; lemma and the same forms, which the list does hold in places -- are merged,
;; and where that leaves one there is nothing to ask.  What remains is labelled
;; with what distinguishes it: the full lemma with its digit, the dictionary
;; offset, and how many forms are attested, which is usually the thing that
;; tells a reader which of two homographs is the one they meant.

THE NUMBER IS THE ANSWER.  Every record of the word list carries one -- the

offset and reads.  So two records with the SAME number are two records of ONE
article, whatever else differs between them, and offering a reader a choice
between them is offering a choice that has no answer.  Their forms are
UNIONED, which is what the records were: the word list splits a long entry's
forms across more than one line.

Two records with DIFFERENT numbers are two articles -- LSJ's λέγω to gather
and λέγω to say, stored `le/gw1' and `le/gw2' under the one key, the word
list being keyed on the lemma with its homograph digit taken off.  That choice
is real and is put to the reader.
